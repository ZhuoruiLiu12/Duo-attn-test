The researchers found that most important historical figures across all Wikipedia language editions were born in western countries after the 17th century and were male. However, each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so the most important historical figures in each edition are often born in the countries that use the language of the edition. The study used methods borrowed from Google to analyze Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. The researchers also used a second method, CheiRank, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of outgoing links. By combining the two methods, the researchers arrived at the final measure, 2DRank. The study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. The study also found that the most important person in the world is Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist who developed the system of binomial nomenclature still used today. The study also found that the most influential academic in history is Karl Marx. The study's findings suggest that Wikipedia's coverage of historical figures is not skewed based on gender, time, or location.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The rectangular building, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK, was discovered during a five-week excavation by the Reading University archaeology summer school. The house, which was built around 2,400 BC, was found to be neatly levelled and regular, with white chalk plastered on the walls. The excavation team also found beautifully crafted flint arrowheads, pottery, bracelets, and a Roman brooch. The team believes that the house was not a permanent residence but was used for feasts and gatherings.

The CDC guidelines are similar, but also include a diagnosis of ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder) or ARBD (alcohol-related birth defects).

Researchers found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. However, the study does not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between the drug and ADHD. The study authors suggest that pregnant women should avoid taking acetaminophen frequently until more research is done. The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers in Denmark. The mothers were asked about their use of painkillers during pregnancy, and the researchers looked at the children's ADHD diagnoses and prescriptions for ADHD medication. The study found that women who reported using acetaminophen frequently during pregnancy were more likely to have children with ADHD-like behaviors. The study also found that taking acetaminophen later in pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of ADHD. The study authors suggest that acetaminophen may interfere with maternal hormones that are important for fetal brain development. However, other experts suggest that the study does not show a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen and ADHD. They also note that ADHD is a complex disorder that is influenced by many factors, including genetics.

The House has approved a plan to fund federal agencies through December 15, which includes conditions related to the new federal health law. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, and Democrats are not planning to come back earlier. The House and Senate could agree on a compromise before the deadline, but if not, a short-term funding bill could be passed to buy more time. The House has added a year-long delay to the implementation of the health law and a repeal of the medical device tax to the funding bill. The Senate is expected to reject these provisions, and if the House does not pass a clean funding bill, a partial government shutdown could occur. The shutdown could have significant effects on the Washington D.C. Area, which relies heavily on federal funding. The shutdown could result in a loss of $200 million per day and affect 700,000 jobs. The shutdown could also impact federal services, such as the processing of benefits and the processing of passport applications. The shutdown could also impact the military, as active-duty personnel would continue to receive pay, but the National Guard and Reserve would not.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe that the planet, which they have named Planet Nine, is a gas giant that is five to ten times the size of Earth and orbits the sun every 10,000 to 20,000 years. The discovery was made by analyzing the orbits of six known dwarf planets and other small objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Brown and Batygin's research suggests that Planet Nine is responsible for the unusual clustering of these objects, as it exerts a gravitational pull on them. The researchers have not directly observed Planet Nine, but they believe that it is located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond Neptune's orbit. The discovery of Planet Nine could change our understanding of the formation of the solar system and the distribution of planets beyond Neptune. Brown and Batygin's research has been published in the Astronomical Journal. \n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debate among astronomers and planetary scientists. Some have questioned the validity of the research, while others have expressed excitement about the possibility of discovering a new planet. The search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes around the world searching for evidence of the elusive planet. \n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate over the definition of a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the term \"planet\" to exclude Pluto and other dwarf planets. The new definition requires a planet to \"clear the neighborhood around its orbit,\" meaning that it must be the dominant object in its orbit. This definition was created to distinguish between planets and dwarf planets, which are smaller and have more elliptical orbits. \n\nThe debate over the definition of a planet has been ongoing since the discovery of Pluto in 1930. Pluto was initially considered to be the ninth planet in our solar system, but its status was challenged when other objects with similar characteristics were discovered in the Kuiper Belt. The IAU's definition of a planet was created to address this issue and to provide a clear distinction between planets and dwarf planets. \n\nThe debate over the definition of a planet has also been fueled by the discovery of exoplanets, or planets outside of our solar system.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that people with coronary artery disease who engage in \"yo-yo\" dieting may be at a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. The study followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease and found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those who experienced the least weight fluctuations. The study was sponsored by Pfizer and published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers suggest that people with coronary artery disease need to keep weight off rather than constantly losing and regaining it. Yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, has been linked to a number of health problems, including an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that the findings suggest that weight fluctuations should be a concern for people with coronary artery disease, who are already at high risk due to their condition. The researchers acknowledge that the study is observational and cannot prove cause and effect, but they believe that the findings warrant further investigation. \n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become damaged or diseased, leading to a buildup of plaque and a narrowing of the arteries. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. If the plaque buildup is severe enough, it can cause a heart attack or stroke. Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and it affects millions of people worldwide. \n\nThe study's findings suggest that maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for people with coronary artery disease. This means avoiding fad diets and focusing on sustainable lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and quitting smoking. It's also important to work with a healthcare provider to manage any underlying health conditions and to take medications as prescribed. By making these lifestyle changes and working with a healthcare provider, people with coronary artery disease can reduce their risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. \n\nIn conclusion, the study's findings suggest that people with coronary artery disease who engage in yo-yo dieting may be at a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, 'Hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one.'\" (Read about what JJ Watt's crowdsourced fundraiser accomplished in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1046}

The lawmaker said it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was, and how it was being transported. The news comes after North Korea's sixth nuclear test, which was the most powerful ever conducted by the rogue nation. The country's state media claimed that it had detonated a hydrogen bomb, which could be fitted onto a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States. Weapons experts say it is almost impossible to verify whether the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea actually fires a nuclear-tipped ICBM. North Korea has conducted several missile tests this year, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range missile in August that flew over Japan. South Korea's Navy conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's nuclear test. The South Korean Navy said it would destroy any North Korean projectiles that entered its waters. The United Nations condemned North Korea's nuclear test, and Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, urged the Security Council to adopt the strongest sanctions measures possible. South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to lift restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles during a phone call. However, there are signs of a rift between the two leaders, with Moon advocating for more dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, while Trump has said that talking is not the answer.

North Korea could launch an intercontinental ballistic missile as soon as Saturday, according to experts. The country celebrates its founding anniversary on September 9. The timing of weapons tests is important to North Korea, as it allows the regime to showcase its military capabilities to the world.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The $130 glasses allow users to take circular videos and post them to their Snapchat accounts. The glasses were previously only available through vending machines in major metro areas and a store in Manhattan. The limited supply caused long lines and high demand, with some people waiting for up to 18 hours to get their hands on a pair. The glasses were also resold online for up to $5,000. Despite the positive response, Snap admitted in its IPO filing that the launch of Spectacles did not generate significant revenue. The company is now selling the glasses online and through vending machines, with a two to four week wait time for delivery. The glasses come in three colors and are limited to six pairs per household. The company's CEO, Evan Spiegel, stated that the idea behind the slow rollout was to test the product and see if it fits into people's lives. The success of Spectacles could bolster Snap's IPO, as the company only needs to sell 4 million pairs to break even this year.

The show was created by Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg, and it initially featured Craig Kilborn as the host. However, when Jon Stewart took over as host in 1999, the show underwent a significant transformation. Stewart brought in new writers, including Ben Karlin and David Javerbaum, who helped to shape the show's satirical approach. The show's correspondents, including Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, and Nancy Walls Carell, also played a crucial role in shaping the show's tone and style. The Daily Show's coverage of the 2000 presidential campaign was a turning point for the show, as it began to focus more on the behind-the-scenes politics and less on the personalities. The show's success led to the creation of The Colbert Report, which ran from 2005 to 2014. The Daily Show's impact on American politics and culture cannot be overstated, as it helped to bring attention to important issues and provided a platform for voices that might not have otherwise been heard.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed toolmaking advances and trading networks in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. This was during the Middle Stone Age, which was previously thought to have started around 280,000 years ago. The tools found in southern Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin were made of obsidian, a volcanic glass that was brought from far away. The researchers believe that the development of these tools was driven by climate change, which caused shifts in the availability of food sources. The people of the time had to travel further to find food, which led to the development of more specialized tools. The researchers also found evidence of pigment, which was likely used for decoration or to mark territory. This discovery suggests that early humans were more advanced than previously thought, and that the development of complex behaviors was not limited to modern humans. The researchers believe that the development of these tools and networks was a key factor in the survival of early humans during times of stress, such as droughts and earthquakes. Overall, this discovery sheds new light on the evolution of early humans and their ability to adapt to changing environments.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Hooper's home became a refuge for Riojas, and he eventually changed his behavior. He started helping around the house and even got a job delivering newspapers. Hooper's husband, Gale, became a positive influence in Riojas' life, and he eventually changed his last name to Hooper. Riojas became a successful man, but he still keeps his past a secret. He is careful not to reveal his struggles to his children, but he is teaching them about their Mexican heritage. Riojas' story is a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of a supportive family. \n\nIn other news, Alexa Internet has been donating its web crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The Founding Fathers believed that habeas corpus was essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy, and it has been a pillar of Western law since the Magna Carta in England in 1215. However, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantánamo Bay and for foreigners labeled as \"enemy combatants\" anywhere in the world, including legal permanent residents of the United States. This provision applies to anyone who is detained by the executive branch and labeled an \"enemy combatant.\" The article argues that this provision erodes the foundation of legal and constitutional frameworks and that the right to habeas corpus is essential to preventing the executive branch from abusing its power. The article also discusses a recent case in which a New York judge granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, who were being held at Stony Brook University.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Mars had a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere four billion years ago. The ocean was at least a mile deep and contained more water than the Arctic Ocean. The discovery was made by analyzing maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form across the Martian globe. The maps showed strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss. The maps also revealed that the released water had a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean. Certain basins and orographic depressions showed even higher enrichment, while high-altitude regions showed much lower values. The atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs was enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which means that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer of at least 137 meters deep. The study suggests that Mars was much wetter and warmer than it is today, with flowing water, streams, and lakes. The discovery supports the notion that life might have existed on Mars in the past. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for signs of life on Mars by looking for chemical signatures of life in the Martian soil. The discovery also suggests that Mars may have lost much of its water over time, with the water near the Martian ice caps being enriched in deuterium.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "New research suggests that dinosaurs may not have roared like we imagine them to. Instead, they may have made sounds similar to those of modern birds, such as cooing or murmuring. The study, which was published in the journal Evolution, found that dinosaurs likely made closed-mouth vocalizations, which are low-frequency sounds that are produced by inflating a pouch in the throat. The researchers analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species and found that only about a quarter of them make these types of sounds. The study also suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations may have evolved independently in different groups of birds and dinosaurs. The researchers believe that this type of vocalization may have been used for mating and territorial displays. The study's findings could shed new light on how dinosaurs communicated with each other and how they may have sounded. However, it is still unclear what specific sounds dinosaurs made, as their vocal organs are not preserved in fossils. The study's lead author, Tobias Riede, said that understanding how birds communicate could help us better understand how dinosaurs communicated as well. The study's findings have implications for how we imagine dinosaurs in popular culture, as they challenge the traditional image of dinosaurs as loud and fierce. Instead, they may have been more subtle and nuanced in their communication. The study's authors suggest that future research could use computer modeling to recreate the sounds of extinct dinosaurs based on their anatomy and the sounds of their living relatives.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The experiment involved the researchers themselves lying still inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine while watching YouTube videos. The MRI machine recorded the brain activity of the participants, which was then used to create a computer model that matched the neural activity with the video. The model was then used to reconstruct a video based on the brain activity recorded by the MRI.

For example, the technology can only reconstruct a fraction of the brain activity that allows us to see moving images. Additionally, the technology cannot yet distinguish between different types of memories or intentions. Despite these limitations, the researchers believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand the human brain and could one day be used to help people with paralysis control their environment by imagining movements.

The scam was a day before he was to start serving a decade-long federal prison term from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. Egeland's insurance scheme and the concocted shooting led to the amputation of his left leg. The additional time was due to Egeland's guilty plea in May to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the elaborate insurance scam, and for interstate failure to pay child support. Egeland's lawyer urged the judge to consider that Egeland already faces a lengthy sentence and that the pain caused to his son should be taken into account. However, the judge called Egeland's insurance scheme and the shooting \"an unthinkable kind of situation\" and added the extra time to his sentence. Egeland's insurance scheme and the shooting came about because he was facing a decade-long federal prison term for his role in a mortgage fraud case. He had orchestrated the fraud through the housing development company where he worked as a vice-president. The fraud led to Egeland being sentenced to 10 years in prison, but he was allowed to surrender himself to prison.

The insurance company quickly discovered the fraud, and Egeland's plan backfired. As a result of the shooting, Egeland had his left leg amputated.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

The couple attempted to reconcile in March, but it was too soon and they have barely spoken since. Holmes has been living in New York City with their daughter Suri, and is slowly building a new life for herself. Additionally, the magazine highlights the key trends to start wearing now, and features an interview with Kristen Wiig, who talks about her past and her career.

Mubarak faces charges of corruption and conspiring to kill protesters. The trial has been bogged down by procedural issues, with lawyers representing the victims calling for the judge to be removed. The trial is expected to continue for several days.
