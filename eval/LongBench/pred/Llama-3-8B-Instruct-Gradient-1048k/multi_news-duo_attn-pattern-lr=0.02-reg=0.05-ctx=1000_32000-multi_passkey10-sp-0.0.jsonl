In Philadelphia, members of Occupy Philadelphia remained on site at City Hall into the evening of Nov. 28, waiting to be rousted for violating a deadline set by Mayor Nutter. However, the expected police eviction had not happened by late Sunday evening, and city officials continued to avoid saying when, or whether, they would throw the Occupiers and their tents off City Hall's so-called front lawn. The city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. Over the last few days, Occupy Philly participants, many homeless, had begun to take down their tents. By 7:15 p.m. Sunday, roughly a third of what originally was about 300 tents were gone. \n\nIn Los Angeles, police in riot gear closed in before dawn on Monday on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall. Police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters after a tense standoff with protesters who had taken over a downtown intersection, but remnants of a crowd that had swelled to 2,000 overnight remained at City Hall. Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. \n\nThe Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks even as other cities moved in to clear out similar camps, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system. Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major U.S. city and the Occupy movement. But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak. \n\nThe overall number of protesters, some wearing gas masks, had grown to at least 2,000 by late Sunday, police estimated. After keeping out of sight throughout the day on Sunday, police began to make their presence known as the mayor's eviction deadline passed, and the protesters' mood turned from calm and festive to rowdy.

At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained.

Kalashnikov, who died in December at the age of 94, wrote a lengthy emotional letter to Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill in May 2012, church officials say. In the letter, Kalashnikov said he was suffering \"spiritual pain\" over the many deaths it caused and questioned whether he was personally responsible for them. The letter, published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin daily, is typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, and he received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour. However, he made little money from his gun. Kalashnikov designed the rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia. The Russian Orthodox Church has sought to consolidate its new-found strength after the Soviet era by building up close ties with state agencies and powerful officials. When Kalashnikov was feted by the Soviet authorities, it would have been unthinkable for him to have declared himself anything else than an atheist. His daughter, Yelena, told Izvestia: \"Of course you can't say he went to services or lived strictly according to the commandments.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears.

Ashton, a low-key British diplomat, said she was taken by military helicopter late Monday to meet with Morsi. She declined to go into detail about her two-hour conversation with him, but she said he had access to newspapers and television and was in good condition. Ashton's two-day visit appeared to have at least temporarily calmed the tense capital after a weekend of violence left at least 80 pro-Morsi demonstrators and a police officer dead, according to the Health Ministry. Morsi's supporters rallied in Cairo on Tuesday night and marched toward the military intelligence headquarters, although no violence had been reported by early Wednesday. Ashton met with a wide range of Egyptian political figures, including Gen. Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces; liberal activists and politicians who supported the coup; and a hard-line Islamist party that backed Morsi's removal but has since wavered in its support for the military. She also met with representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood. Ashton said Monday that she hoped the meetings would facilitate conversations that might lead to a political solution. But she stressed that Egyptians, and particularly those in power, must ensure that the country moves forward along a democratic path. Officials from the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, from which Morsi hails, told Ashton that any political solution for Egypt must be based on \"the return of the president,\" the party said in a statement. The statement said the demonstrations in support of Morsi would not stop until \"constitutional legitimacy\" was restored. His backers have used that phrase to refer to returning him to power, as well as to reinstating the country's Islamist-dominated parliament and the constitution ratified under Morsi through a popular referendum. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke by telephone Tuesday with Sissi, a Hagel spokesman said, adding that the secretary urged \"restraint\" in dealing with protesters and called for \"an inclusive reconciliation process.\" \n\nOverall, Ashton's meeting with Morsi and her subsequent meetings with various Egyptian political figures suggest that the EU is trying to facilitate a political solution to the ongoing crisis in Egypt.

The firm has offered to waive its attempt to recover legal costs from Pao if she agrees not to pursue an appeal in her gender discrimination case against the firm. The offer was made in papers filed this week in California Superior Court in San Francisco. The firm said the case, which drew an abundance of unfavorable attention to its inner workings and the fate of women in Silicon Valley, cost it $972,815 in witness fees, deposition and court reporter costs. The vast majority of the fees Kleiner is trying to recover are for witnesses. The fees for Paul Gompers, a professor at Harvard Business School, were $92,700, the filing says. Kleiner Perkins has offered to waive its legal costs should Pao choose not to appeal, according to firm spokeswoman Christina Lee. Kleiner’s costs request includes about $865,000 in expert witness fees, the court filing said. Pao and her legal team are considering the proposal, said Heather Wilson, a spokeswoman for Pao. Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner. Her career deteriorated after he and Kleiner Perkins started retaliating against her in a climate that was overall unfriendly toward women, her lawyers argued. A jury at the end of March rejected all of Ms. Pao’s claims. Legal fees, which must have been considerable on both sides, are not on the table. Pao has not said whether she will pursue an appeal, and the grounds on which she would do so are uncertain.

McCullough was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. The dark-haired second-grader with big brown eyes was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957 when they were approached by a stranger who said his name was Johnny. He gave Maria two piggyback rides, Sigman told police at the time. Sigman, now a grandmother known as Kathy Chapman, said she went home to fetch her mittens. When she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects -- including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home. Because Maria apparently never left Illinois, the FBI pulled out of the investigation and the case went cold for half a century. The Illinois State Police began to look into the Ridulph case again in 2008, after McCullough's half sister, Janet Tessier, emailed a tip. She said her dying mother had pulled her close some 14 years earlier and whispered, \"Those two little girls, and the one that disappeared, John did it.

The case was reopened in 2008, and McCullough was arrested in 2011 and convicted the following year. After an appeal by McCullough, Illinois state's attorney Richard Schmack launched a six-month investigation that found what he calls \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough is innocent.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened.

According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. MRSA, a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia, becomes resistant to antibiotics and often affects individuals in hospitals or other health care settings. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. MRSA exposed to the smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The study also found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for the alternative theory that cigarette smoke makes the pathogen tougher.

The study used methods borrowed from Google to analyze Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. The study found that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male. The study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The study took as its starting point Google's PageRank algorithm, which says that a page is important if a lot of important pages link to it. The study also used CheiRank, which measures the number of incoming links, while the CheiRank measures the number of outgoing links. The final measure was 2DRank, which mixed Pagerank and CheiRank together. The study found that the world's most influential mind was Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Linnaeus beat out everyone, from the Pope to President Obama to Frank Sinatra, Hitler, Caesar—even Jesus. The study also found that intellectual success depends on what has come before, and that some people are just more influential than others. The study was not the first time people have tried to figure out the influence of various historical people, and Linnaeus is not a reliable entrant on the list.

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and the cause is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections like polio and non-polio enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. In August 2014, physicians at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colorado, noted a cluster of cases of acute limb weakness among children, which coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).

The investigation, which was reported in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, is the first such analysis of the cloth, looking at its purported blood splatters and their alignment to each other in a kind of crime scene analysis. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse, adding to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The bloodstain pattern investigation was conducted by forensic anthropologist Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK and organic chemist Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences. They used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric. By pumping blood onto a model at wound points depicted on the shroud, they could compare the angle that gravity pulled the liquid against the direction seen on the linen. They discovered the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. The researchers found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, Borrini said, “the bloodstains shouldn’t be so inconsistent.” The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. The cloth has long been the subject of debate and study, with radiocarbon dating determining its origin to be between 1260 and 1390.

Davis, who became a national political sensation by filibustering her state's tough new restrictions on abortion, writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy in the book as well. Davis considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her nearly 13-hour speech on the floor of the Texas Senate last summer, but decided against it, saying \"such an unexpected and dramatically personal confession would overshadow the events of the day.\" The second pregnancy happened in 1996, and Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. But a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery, she writes. Davis goes on to say that an \"indescribable blackness followed\" the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed. The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" In the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes. Davis' filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide.

Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized.

Reading University archaeologist Dr Jim Leary described the skeleton as a \"wonderful discovery\". Scientific analysis will provide information on the gender of the child, diet, pathologies, and date of burial. It may also shed light on where this young individual had lived. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. Findings to date include flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. During the last six weeks, the team has focused on Marden henge and Wilsford henge. Built in 2,400 BC, Marden henge is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago in what is now northeastern China. The dinosaur, named Caihong juji, had feathers that may have glittered with the colors of the rainbow. The feathers on its head and chest seem to have been covered with iridescent feathers akin to those on modern hummingbirds. The flashy display may have provided a social or sexual cue, like modern peacock tails. The dinosaur also has a bird-like body, including the sorts of feathers required for flight, but it has a crested head that more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor. Caihong lived in forests and may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards. The duck-size carnivore would’ve weighed roughly a pound. The team found that its well-preserved remnants contained traces of pigment in its feathers. The team sampled 66 sites across the fossil, comparing the melanosomes they saw with melanosomes from modern bird feathers. On Caihong’s head, chest, and parts of its tail, the researchers saw melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets. These patterns most closely match the melanosomes in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds. The team couldn’t reconstruct the dinosaur feathers’ exact colors, but they suspect that the observed pigments gave Caihong a rainbow glimmer. Caihong may not have used just its feathers for showing off, notes University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte, who reviewed the study before publication. Its plumage was a shiny rainbow of iridescent colors … but it didn't stop there,” he says. “It also had a funky crest of bone sticking up in front of its eyes, which was probably a display structure as well.” With Caihong, “who knows what the functions of this large, wide tail were?” says National Geographic explorer Ryan Carney, a University of South Florida biologist who studies Archaeopteryx. “Perhaps it was held up as a dark background to provide contrast against the iridescent head during displays?” Paleontologists have seen this sparkle in dinosaurs before. In 2012, scientists found evidence that the feathered dinosaur Microraptor glinted blue in the sun like modern crows and grackles. Unlike Caihong, though, Microraptor was iridescent all over—and it is much younger: Microraptor lived a full 40 million years after Caihong.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

{"pred": "Seattle has implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, which has caused controversy among residents and businesses. The tax was intended to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for important projects, and subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. However, opponents argue that soda taxes don't make people healthier, don't raise revenue, and don't help ease inequality. They also argue that the tax is regressive, meaning it disproportionately affects low-income families. The tax has caused a significant increase in prices, with a case of Gatorade now costing $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. Business managers and customers are not stupid, and retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. Seattle's tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. In fact, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington. Nanny staters have looked to Seattle to fulfill their dream of running our lives. The people of the city need to speak up and end this nightmare. \n\nA bill is being re-introduced to bring the Seattle soda tax statewide. The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. Local representative Marcus Riccelli co-sponsored the bill originally, and said he doesn't believe the bill will go anywhere this year or be brought up for a committee vote. However, some are worried about the tax coming to Spokane. Seattle leaders say the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension. Some here in Spokane agree that's a good thing. Seattle is expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. It will be using part of the money to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families. \n\nMen of the West!

The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits.

The key features of FASD include growth deficiency, FAS facial features, central nervous system damage, and prenatal alcohol exposure. \n\nDiagnosing FASD is complicated because the key features can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum. The central nervous system damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus. \n\nFAS facial features include a smooth philtrum, thin vermilion, and small palpebral fissures. Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide, a five-point Likert Scale with", "answers": ["Let's hope Snooki sorta planned that baby she's reportedly carrying (stop giggling).

The study analyzed data from over 64,000 children enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort study between 1996 and 2002.

The House voted early Sunday morning to approve a plan to fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, which includes conditions related to the new federal health law. Senate Democrats say they will reject any changes to the health law, and President Barack Obama would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has a powerful incentive to continue to press his party’s fight against the health law: Conservatives in the House Republican conference are clamoring for a confrontation over it, and they have the votes to make trouble for Boehner on this and many other fiscal matters. If the House eventually accepts a spending bill with no major changes to the health law, Republicans will be unlikely to do so until the last minute. It may even be that a short government shutdown will have to take place to satisfy the conservatives’ desire to show they fought as much as they could. Republicans believe there is some chance that the Senate will agree to repeal the medical device tax, giving the House GOP a victory. Test votes earlier this year in the Senate showed broad, bipartisan support for the repeal. However, the leading Democratic proponent of the repeal –Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — has said she does not favor tacking it onto the spending bill. Senate leadership aides say they are confident they have the votes to beat the amendment. Democrats could receive the bill and then table the amendments to delay the health law and to repeal the medical device tax, which could be achieved with a 51-vote majority. A shutdown appears a near certainty at this point. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise between now and Monday night, but it is not clear how that would materialize or how it could be passed quickly—especially through the rule-laden Senate.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

In a separate incident, a lion escaped from the park and mauled a man on a busy street in the capital. In South Africa, a lion named Sylvester had escaped from Karoo National Park. Like in Kenya, wildlife officials said he posed a threat. On Wednesday, they prepared to kill him. This is not the first time Sylvester has strayed away from the park. Conservationists have a reason to try and save the king of the jungle. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a “vulnerable” species. A study last year found that its population had declined by 50 percent in the past 20 years. \n\nOverall, the news highlights the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century because of unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat, and growing conflict with livestock herders. The cases of African lions on the loose highlight the need for better management of natural resources and infrastructure development. The surge in escapes from Nairobi National Park is attributed to habitat loss, as the park is getting encroached on by lucrative development projects. The government also started building a highway through a section of the park, agitating the animals with constant noise. The death of Mohawk and the potential killing of Sylvester have sparked an outcry among citizens, who are calling for more humane methods", "answers": ["An escaped lion, a taunting crowd, and an ill-prepared first-response team came together in Kenya to cause what some are saying was the unnecessary, senseless death of the lion, the country's Star reports. Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion who was one of Nairobi National Park's most well-known creatures due to his trademark mane and rep as somewhat of a \"ladies' lion,\" had escaped from an unfenced section of the park and ended up in the town of Isinya, where he was promptly surrounded by a jeering group of men, the Washington Post reports. Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN. A bunch of lions have busted out of the park lately, driven by what conservationists say is the noise from development projects, including a highway being built through the park.

The vessel was found in a reliquary that dates back to the sixth century C.E. And was once part of an early Christian basilica named after Saint John the Theologian. The vessel is decorated with crosses and is believed to have healing properties. The discovery was made during excavations of the ancient and medieval port of Burgos (or Poros) on Cape Foros in the Black Sea city of Burgas. The reliquary was found in the 6th century basilica and is considered one of the most important discoveries in the history of the Burgas Regional History Museum. The lead tube reliquary is unique because the images on it are identical with the images from a group of clay tube reliquaries produced in ancient Ephesus. The discovery of the lead tube reliquary with ashes from the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus near Burgas resembles another relic discovery from the same region, Bulgaria's Southern Black Sea coast. In 2010, during excavations of an ancient monastery on the St. Ivan (St. John) Island in the Black Sea, off the coast of Bulgaria's Sozopol, just to the north of Burgas, Bulgarian archaeologist Prof. Kazimir Popkonstantinov discovered a reliquary containing relics of St. John the Baptist. The relics of St. John the Baptist, which consist of small bone particles from a skull, jaw bone, arm bone, and tooth, have received lots of international interest in the years since then, and in February 2015 CNN reported that Oxford University scholars had confirmed the possibility of their authenticity by concluding that they belonged to a man who lived in the Middle East at the same time as Jesus Christ. The ancient and medieval fortress and port of Burgos (Poros) is located on the Cape of Foros in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of Burgas. It was first first excavated in 2008 by archaeologists Milen Nikolov (currently Director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History), Dr. Tsonya Drazheva, and Konstantin Gospodinov, after access to its site was denied for decades because of the existence of a nearby military base which has been closed down in recent years.

{"pred": "Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have found evidence of a giant icy planet lurking in the darkness of our solar system far beyond the orbit of Pluto. They are calling it \"Planet Nine.\" The planet's mass is estimated to be five to 10 times that of the Earth, but the authors, astronomers Michael Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly. Instead, they have inferred its existence from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system. The astronomers suggest it might have been flung into deep space long ago by the gravitational force of Jupiter or Saturn. Telescopes on at least two continents are searching for the object, which on average is 20 times farther away than the eighth planet, Neptune. Confirmation of its existence would reconfigure the models of the solar system. The past two decades have seen a burst of discoveries as astronomers have scrutinized the light of distant stars and looked for signs of orbiting planets. More than a thousand such planets have been detected through analysis of starlight that has traveled across the vast interstellar distances. Brown and Batygin, however, have been searching closer to home, looking for objects that orbit the sun and remain unseen only because the outer regions of the solar system are exceedingly dark. The thought of a hidden planet larger than Earth is intriguing, but for now it's difficult to say too much about the hypothetical conditions there. Brown believes it's probably an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas – a planet that could have been the core of a gas giant had it not been ejected into a wonky, highly elliptical orbit. It might not make its closest approach of the sun more than once every 10,000 years, and even then it would remain far beyond the known planets. The situation mimics what happened in the 19th century when careful observation of the seventh planet, Uranus, indicated that there must be another body in far-distant space influencing its orbit. That work led eventually to the discovery of Neptune. The two know they may not get credit for that discovery. Until the planet is spotted directly with a telescope, any work surrounding it is theoretical. Brown, Batygin and other scientists who have made the case for Planet Nine's existence are providing treasure maps and clues – but someone else could very well strike gold before they do.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The lawmaker said it was unclear when the movement was detected, what the direction of the projectile was, and how it was being transported. This comes after North Korea's sixth test of a nuclear weapon, which seismological data indicated was the most powerful ever detonated by the rogue nation, nuclear experts said. North Korean state media claimed it detonated a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which could be fitted atop a long-range missile capable of striking the United States. Weapons experts say it's almost impossible to verify if the warhead and missile could be successfully paired unless North Korea were to actually fire a nuclear-tipped ICBM. North Korea has test-fired a number of missiles this summer, including two long-range ones in July and an intermediate-range one in August that overflew the Japanese island of Hokkaido. South Korea's Navy conducted a live-fire drill in response to North Korea's Sunday nuclear test, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his American counterpart, President Donald Trump, spoke by phone Monday and agreed to lift current restrictions on the payload weight of South Korea's ballistic missiles. However, signs of a rift between the two leaders have become apparent despite the decades-long alliance between Seoul and Washington. Moon has long been a proponent of more dialogue and diplomacy with North Korea, whereas Trump has said recently that \"talking is not the answer.\" North Korea could launch yet another missile as soon as Saturday when the country celebrates its founding day, hot on the heels of its biggest-to-date nuclear test. The timing of weapons tests is of strategic importance, and Pyongyang is unlikely to provoke at a time when it expects another major event to be dominating the headlines. Diplomats in New York gathered at the United Nations and condemned the nuclear test, and Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said Monday the United States would circulate a resolution in response after urging her colleagues to adopt the strongest sanctions measures possible to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program.

The study, conducted by the University of Michigan, analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger-than-50 colorectal cancer patients overall lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50, and whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. The report was published online in the journal Cancer. \n\nThe study also found that colon cancer rates are rising among men and women under 50, the age at which guidelines recommend screenings start. One in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The study raises the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age. The report was published online in the journal Cancer. \n\nThe study also highlights the importance of early detection of colorectal cancer. Signs of colorectal cancer include anemia, a dramatic change in the size or frequency of bowel movements, and dark blood or blood mixed with stool, (sometimes appearing as black threads), in bowel movements. Because these symptoms may be nonexistent, mild, or infrequent, many people are not aware of their condition until their malignancy becomes advanced and spreads into the lymph nodes. A colonoscopy is the usual screening test, but stool tests are also effective for some people. If you are worried, you can request your primary care physician provide you with one of these simple stool tests, no matter your age. \n\nOverall, the study suggests that the medical community needs to be more aware of the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The site, known as Warratyi rock-shelter, contains evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. The presence of bones from juvenile animals in a cave on a cliff suggests they were hunted, said Gavin Prideaux, palaeontologist at Flinders University in South Australia. The site also contains the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia around 49,000-46,000 years ago. The artefacts excavated at the site also push back the earliest-known dates on the development of key bone and stone axe technologies and the use of ochre in Australia. The timing of the human settlement shows people moved through central Australia and used key technologies such as stone axes and ochre much earlier than previously thought. The site, which is a newly discovered cave in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, is significant because it shows Aboriginal Australians settled the arid interior of the country around 49,000 years ago — some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.

The man, Dallas Swonger, insists that he did not urinate in the water, but rather on the wall next to it. Swonger and two friends were given written citations for trespassing and barred from Mt. Tabor for 30 days. Portland Water Bureau officials are working with the Multnomah County District Attorney to determine whether there are criminal charges to be filed. While human pee is not a health hazard, the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. The whole ordeal has Swonger pretty rattled. The incident has drawn mention of Portland by national and international news media, with some disbelieving or out-and-out derisive comments. The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city’s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor’s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016.

The decision to empty and clean the reservoir has drawn mention of Portland -- much of it disbelieving or out-and-out derisive -- by national and international news media. The chief point of contention: Reservoir 5 can hold up to 50 million gallons of water. The typical adult human bladder can hold two or so cups of urine. So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning’s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed advanced toolmaking techniques and trading networks in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. The tools, which were found in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, were made from obsidian and were used for specific purposes such as blades, scrapers, and spearheads. The researchers believe that long periods of stress from repeated earthquakes and cycles of drought and heavy rains may have pushed these early humans to partner up with neighboring communities to come up with ways to cope. The new studies also show that by 320,000 years ago, this technology was well established in the region, suggesting that human ancestors likely started developing it even earlier. The findings challenge the view that modernity arose outside of Africa and suggest that hominin populations did not disappear – so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering, and sharing, and innovation. The discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin are exciting because they show that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly “modern” things at this critical time period, suggesting expanded social networks, transmission of information, and technological innovation. The findings also suggest that the “human revolution” that made us modern never was – archaeological evidence for modern behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The airline has reduced the boarding lines to two from five and is urging travelers to wait until their boarding group is called. United has also launched push notifications for those who have the mobile app, which will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. The new system has been in affect at Los Angeles International Airport since February and will now roll out to all United locations beginning Tuesday. United's changes hint at the struggle airlines have had in creating a boarding process that doesn't stress out customers. Even with precisely delineated groups and queues, many travelers still feel compelled to stand in line to hold their spot. Southwest, of course, has its own type of system since it has no assigned seats. It calls for fliers in its “A” group to line up at their corresponding pillars, which display numbers indicating where passengers should stand. As the “A” group boards, Southwest repeats the process for the “B” and “C” groups until all passengers have boarded.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

Johnson was arrested as part of an undercover sting operation by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office. He had called the number on an escort ad on Backpage.com and arranged to pay $100 for 30 minutes with two prostitutes. When he arrived at the hotel room, he was let in and handed over the $100. He had two condoms in his pocket when he was arrested. Johnson was named Miami Gardens' Police chief in May 2014 after a long career with the North Miami Police Department. He also served as North Miami's city manager from 2011 to 2014. Johnson's arrest has again thrust the police department into a negative spotlight. It comes just days after protesters marched into City Hall to express their anger over the fatal police shooting of a mentally ill man fewer than two weeks ago. Johnson's arrest was another setback for a troubled agency rocked by allegations of racial profiling. The expectations had been high for Johnson, a veteran cop. He’d come with 30 years of experience working in the public sector. Rising from a rookie cop to police chief in North Miami during the first 27 years, he then transitioned to the city’s administration when he was appointed interim city manager in August 2011. Within three months, he was given the permanent job. By spring 2014, city administrators in Miami Gardens were looking for a new top cop after losing former chief Matthew Boyd — the young city’s first and only police chief at the time — and his deputy chief Paul Miller when they resigned amid allegations of harassment and illegal stop-and-frisk tactics at the 207 Quikstop. The scandal, brought to light after the Miami Herald obtained surveillance videos from the convenience store owners showing cops’ behavior, left a blemish on the department’s reputation. In April 2014, Johnson donned the four gold stars on his collar for Miami Gardens as he set out to improve the reputation of the police department. He did make some strides in gaining favor with the community. At his first appearance before the City Council last year, he gave the public his cell phone number to make himself accessible. He was more present at community events and crime watch meetings. Before he was hired in Miami Gardens, Johnson did face some controversy when he was police chief in North Miami.

The DWSD has been accused of ignoring the debts of large entities while going after people who owe as little as $150 on their accounts. The department has also been accused of shutting off accounts of families with young children, as well as houses with disabled and elderly residents. The water department says it needs to shut off the water to recoup some $175 million in outstanding bills. However, activists say that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent, and where water bills are higher than in much of the country, Detroit should work out a solution with poor residents instead of leaving them dry. The pressure seems to be partially working: DWSD announced a $1 million fund on Tuesday for residents struggling to pay.

The Russian Embassy in Ottawa criticized the Canadian government for ignoring appeals by Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure that justice be served.

However, Kieran's new ears will boost his confidence and improve his performance at school. \n\nKieran's surgery was primarily cosmetic, but it brings huge psychological benefits. The surgery is not to improve hearing, but it can change the confidence of a patient at a young age, which can change their whole trajectory in life. Advances in tissue engineering mean that this kind of reconstructive surgery could be done quite differently within a decade. Scientists at the Institute of Child Health are creating stem cells from patients' fat tissue, which can be induced to make cartilage or bone. Last year, scientists in the US implanted a human-like ear, grown from cow and sheep cells, onto a rat. However, such research is still at its early stages, and for the foreseeable future, children needing new ears will benefit from the same procedure used at Great Ormond Street Hospital. \n\nOverall, Kieran's surgery was a success, and he is delighted with the result. He will need a second operation in six months to make his ears stand out from the scalp more, but he is already happy with the outcome. His parents are also happy with the result and hope that Kieran will be accepted like everyone else. The surgery has given Kieran a new lease on life, and he is excited to wear sunglasses and earphones like his friends. \n\nIn conclusion, Kieran's story is an inspiring one. Despite being born without ears, he has overcome his challenges and is now able to hear and look like his peers. His surgery has not only improved his physical appearance but also his mental health. Kieran's story shows that with the right support and medical advancements, anything is possible.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The animal wandered into Liziba village, in the northwestern province of Gansu, where local officials trying to capture it chased it onto Guan's land. The panda bit him in the leg and only released its grip when another villager covered its head with a coat. The incident in March last year left Guan with injuries requiring seven hours of surgery.

He led the country to a swift victory in the Persian Gulf War and oversaw the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union and unification of Germany. Bush was a successful businessman, member of Congress, envoy to the United Nations and China, head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Republican Ronald Reagan's vice president in 1980. He lost his bid for re-election to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, after a campaign in which he was hampered by two years of disappointing economic performance and an insurrection among his own party's conservatives over a decision to raise taxes. In subsequent years, historians have been far kinder regarding the Bush presidency than were voters at the time. Bush also won some degree of vindication when his eldest son, George W. Bush, won the White House in 2000, making Bush the only American since John Adams to be both a president and father of a president. Bush was born in Massachusetts and joined the Navy during World War II, becoming its youngest pilot. He married his girlfriend, Barbara Pierce, and finished his education at Yale, but eschewed the path to Wall Street that his family ties offered. Bush became a businessman in the oil-field supply, exploration, and production businesses and later co-founded Zapata Petroleum, which pioneered offshore oil-drilling platforms. Bush's shining moment as vice president came in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, when the president lay near death in the hospital and the nation seemed leaderless. Bush proved himself willing to use American military might elsewhere, taking military action in 1989 when he ordered the removal of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Bush inspired generations of Americans to public service, and in retirement, he undertook a few diplomatic missions and celebrated his birthday into his mid-80s with a parachute jump.

The Founders of the United States believed that habeas corpus was essential to preserving liberty, justice, and democracy, and it was enshrined in the first article of the United States Constitution. However, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantánamo Bay and for any foreigner the government detains anywhere and labels an \"enemy combatant.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, meaning someone who has lived in the U.S. for years could potentially be labeled an \"enemy combatant\" and then thrown into prison with no legal recourse to challenge their detention. The government has little or no evidence against most of the men detained at Guantánamo, and the overwhelming majority were sold into captivity by Northern Alliance and Pakistani warlords for substantial bounties. The Nonhuman Rights Project has filed a case in New York, seeking to free two research chimpanzees at Stony Brook University from captivity. The group claimed that the chimpanzees were too cognitively and emotionally complex to be held in captivity and should be relocated to an established chimpanzee sanctuary. The ruling marks the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, which typically allows human prisoners to challenge their detention.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet’s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. The ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. The view of the planet’s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet’s frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. The ocean lasted for millions of years, but over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned, and the drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. The finding sparked intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. It might, but there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life. The evidence continues to mount that Mars was once far wetter—and, since the water was mostly in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it's now locked up, much warmer—than it is today. That, along with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology, means support for the notion that life might once have existed on Mars is only getting stronger.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "The European Court of Justice has dismissed appeals by both Nestle and Mondelez in a long-running legal battle over the shape of KitKat finger wafers. The ruling means that the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestle's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit over objections raised by Mondelez. The Luxembourg court found that Nestle had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed an appeal by Mondelez against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016 that had found the EUIPO was wrong to reject the U.S. Firm's complaint. The outcome leaves open that the trademark agency could, while respecting the judges' ruling, take account of other evidence - such as new proof the shape is distinctive to people in more countries - and might preserve protection for KitKat's shape. The case has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. It has also been featured in Britain's Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat first marketed by Rowntree's, which was bought by the Swiss in 1988. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestle objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury, bought by the Americans in 2010, to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. \n\nIn other news, Lindt reportedly suggested its rival change their gold wrapper to bronze, and ban the red ribbon, after Swiss chocolatier Lindt applied for a trademark for its Easter bunnies with a red ribbon, which are iconic in many countries - but not all. In Germany, the Riegelein company also made gold-wrapped bunnies, and the case made it to both European and German courts - where Lindt eventually lost. Meanwhile, Mondelez won the argument that you can't trademark the shape of a Kit Kat, but it's sure you can trademark a Toblerone - which it owns. Toblerone's shape was registered in 1998 - but was only put to the test last year, when British retailer Poundland designed an off-brand version. Featuring two rows of triangular bumps rather than one, Poundland argued that its copycat wasn't a trademark infringement - especially since Tob", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "The T. rex's roar has been a staple of dinosaur movies for decades, but new research suggests that dinosaurs may not have sounded like that at all. Instead, they may have made sounds closer to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. The study, which analyzed the noises made by many living bird and crocodilian species, found that dino sounds may be what scientists call \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" These are low, throaty whooshes of air that are produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch, which enables birds with proportionally large bodies to produce the low murmurs. The researchers suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities. \n\nThe study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations are unlikely to be ancestral in birds and have evolved independently at least 16 times within Aves, predominantly in large-bodied lineages. The researchers identified 52 out of 208 investigated bird species that use closed-mouth vocalization. The association with large bodies is a matter of physics, as the inflation of an elastic cavity could present a size-dependent challenge. \n\nThe occurrence of closed-mouth vocalization across birds and crocodiles indicates that closed-mouth vocalization can emerge in diverse archosaur species depending on behavioral or environmental circumstances. Because dinosaurs are members of the archosaur group, and many had large body sizes, it is likely that some dinosaurs made closed-mouthed vocalizations in a manner similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, at this point in time, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like. \n\nFuture research by this collaboration will integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression and sound modeling to understand the sounds that extinct early avian species, and perhaps their dinosaur ancestors, produced. \n\nOverall, the study offers clues about how dinosaurs may have sounded and sheds light on the evolution of a specialized way birds emit sound.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The lawyers claim that even on social media, jurors would have seen friends and relatives posting about the 2013 bombing, making it impossible for Tsarnaev to receive a fair trial. The appeal also argues that the recent Supreme Court ruling about the vagueness of the definition of a \"crime of violence\" throws many convictions into question. Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 federal charges in the bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260. He apologized at his sentencing. Despite the dramatic news from court, the Boston Marathon bomber’s fate will take years to reach its conclusion, as only three of 340 prisoners sentenced to federal death row have been executed in the last 50 years. Many of his new federal death row peers have been sitting waiting for the appeals process to work its way out for more than 20 years. The prisoner’s team of legal defenders, led by Judy Clarke, have already indicated two strong lines of likely appeal: that on prejudicial grounds the trial should never have been held in Boston where the bombings happened; and that the defense was given insufficient time to mount a full argument in mitigation that might have convinced the jury to spare Tsarnaev from the federal death chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana. Most capital cases in the US are handled by individual death penalty states, mainly in the deep south, while the involvement of the federal government in America’s most controversial judicial practice has become increasingly unusual in modern times.

It has save states that allow users to quickly freeze and resume gameplay, without having to save just by switching on and off the console. There’s also background downloading, which allows digital titles to be played before they’re even completely on your local drive. Social is another key tentpole for the PS4, according to Cerny. He described a new function that allows you to quickly pause and upload gameplay videos as easily as you might have done with static screenshots in the past. There’s also spectator functionality for watching “celebrities” gaming, something which seems to have been borrowed from Twitter’s success with famous members. Networking will also be based around real names and profile pictures, instead of strictly on gamer tags and avatars, too, and all of this will plug into mobile apps to help gamers stay in touch.

The team used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines to record the amount of blood flowing through the visual cortex of their subjects as they watched YouTube videos. The brain activity was then fed into a computer to program a \"movie reconstruction algorithm,\" which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video. The algorithm learned to associate certain neural patterns with dynamic information against 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos. The subjects then watched the same set of trailers as the algorithm pieced together a video based on brain activity recorded by the MRI. The result is a continuous, if abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos. This is a major leap towards reconstructing internal imagery and could pave the way for eventually being able to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation: dreams and thoughts. The technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery, the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. The researchers say the technology could also be used to decode things in the brain that are movie-like but have no real-world analog, like dreams. The brain activity measured in this study is just a fraction of the activity that lets us see moving images. Other, more complex areas help us interpret the content of those images -- distinguish faces from lifeless objects, for example. The researchers hope to look at more visual modules, and try to build models for every single part of visual system.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
