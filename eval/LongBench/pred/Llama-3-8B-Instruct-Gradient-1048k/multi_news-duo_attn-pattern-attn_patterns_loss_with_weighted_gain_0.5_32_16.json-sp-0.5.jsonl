The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary. So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The probe will be named after solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958. The probe will attempt to get within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, which is closer than any other spacecraft has been before. The probe will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite shield to protect it from the sun's heat and radiation. The probe will also be equipped with a solar array cooling system to keep the spacecraft at a safe temperature. The probe will attempt to solve two long-standing puzzles: how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's outer atmosphere is hotter than its surface. The probe will also attempt to improve our understanding of space weather and its impact on Earth. The probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun over the course of seven years. The probe will be equipped with a chip containing photos of Parker and his seminal paper on solar wind. The probe will also have a plate with a message from Parker. The probe will be launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The probe's mission is expected to last until 2025.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

{"pred": "A new study suggests that people with coronary artery disease who engage in yo-yo dieting may be at a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. The study followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease and found that those who experienced the largest fluctuations in weight over a five-year period had a 78% higher risk of developing new onset diabetes, a 117% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death. The study, sponsored by Pfizer, is published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Yo-yo dieting, or weight cycling, is defined as repeatedly losing and gaining weight. Previous studies have linked weight cycling to an increased risk of heart disease, and this study suggests that the risk may be even higher for people with pre-existing coronary artery disease. The study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasizes the importance of maintaining weight loss over time rather than just focusing on losing weight initially. The study's findings highlight the need for further research into the effects of weight fluctuations on people with coronary artery disease. \n\nCoronary artery disease occurs when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This damage is usually caused by cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation. As plaque builds up, it narrows the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart. This can lead to chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, or other symptoms. If the plaque buildup is severe enough, it can cause a complete blockage, resulting in a heart attack. \n\nCoronary artery disease often develops over many years, and people may not experience symptoms until they have a significant blockage or a heart attack. However, there are steps people can take to prevent and manage coronary artery disease. A healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking, can make a significant difference. Additionally, medications and other treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. \n\nOverall, the study's findings emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle to reduce the risk of coronary artery disease and its complications. People with pre-existing coronary artery disease should be particularly mindful of their weight fluctuations and work with their healthcare providers to develop a plan to manage their weight and prevent complications.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that dramatic shifts in the East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives by the Middle Stone Age, roughly 320,000 years ago. The oldest innovations were axes designed to be held in the palm of the hand, which were shaped like a tear drop, with a rounded end and a pointed eye. These axes were used for chopping down branches or the carcasses of large animals. The axes were used for several hundred thousand years, from 1.2 million years ago to 500,000 years ago, and the technology remained largely unchanged during that time. However, around 320,000 years ago, the ancient humans seem to have switched to an entirely new technology. The scientists found numerous smaller, flatter, sharper stone tools, which were designed for specific purposes, such as blades, scrapers, or spearheads. The tools were made of stone like obsidian, which originated far from the excavation site. The obsidian wasn't the only exotic material; they also discovered bright red ochre pigment, which was the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments. The discovery of these tools and materials suggests that hominid populations were developing trading networks and exchanging goods with neighboring communities. The researchers believe that the development of these tools and networks was driven by long-term, global environmental and climatic changes. The discovery challenges the previous belief that modernity arose outside of Africa and suggests that modernity was already present in Africa before the species migrated to other parts of the world.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Vladimir Katriuk, a native of Ukraine who had been an avid beekeeper for years in Ormstown, Quebec, was at the center of allegations that he participated in a village massacre in 1943 in what is now known as Belarus. The Russian Embassy in Ottawa criticized the Canadian government for ignoring numerous appeals by Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure that justice be served, allowing Katriuk to retain citizenship of Canada while peacefully residing in the country. The Federal Court ruled in 1999 that Katriuk lied about his voluntary service for German authorities during the war in order to obtain Canadian citizenship. However, in 2007, the Canadian government overturned an earlier decision to revoke Katriuk’s citizenship due to a lack of evidence. A recent study alleged that Katriuk was a key participant in a village massacre during the Second World War. The study claimed that Katriuk was a member of a Ukrainian battalion of the SS, the elite Nazi storm troops, between 1942 and 1944. Katriuk denied the accusations against him. The Russian Embassy in Ottawa called on the Canadian government to support a criminal case against Katriuk, but Canada ignored the request and stated that it would never recognize Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine.

Carlie's mother Shannon Trent tells People she felt \"sick to my stomach\" when she heard about those purchases. \"I don't know what he's done to her,\" she says. \"I don't think he would hurt her, but if he's capable of kidnapping a child he's capable of anything.\" Authorities believe Carlie is in \"imminent danger.\" Simpson also purchased camping supplies and nonperishable groceries, and authorities think he may be hiding with Carlie in an isolated area. The TBI says there have been rumors online that Simpson is trying to protect Carlie, but it says that couldn't be further from the truth. \"This was not an innocent camping trip, this was a crime,\" a spokesperson tells WATE. Simpson, Carlie's uncle by marriage, and his wife once had custody of Carlie, but her father James Trent had custody at the time of her abduction. Shannon Trent, who hasn't had custody of Carlie in two years, says she \"always had a bad feeling\" about Simpson. \"I should have stuck with my gut,\" she tells People.

The legislation makes possession of up to 2oz of marijuana a petty offense that can result in a fine rather than a criminal record. It also allows for the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The new law paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The move is part of a global trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and Colorado and Washington legalized personal use in 2014. In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to create a legal marijuana market. The legislation has been a long time coming, with debate about decriminalizing marijuana in Jamaica dating back to the 1970s. However, previous attempts to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana were scuttled due to concerns that it would violate international treaties and result in sanctions from the US. Despite this, Jamaican officials believe that the island can become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative pot-derived products. The new law has been welcomed by cannabis advocates, who see it as a step in the right direction, but note that there is still much work to be done.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that an ocean at least a mile deep once covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers in the Martian atmosphere. The study found that the water vapor on Mars contains a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, than Earth's oceans. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time, equivalent to more than six times the amount of water currently locked up in the planet's polar ice caps. The researchers estimate that the water would have covered the entire planet to a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters) if it had been evenly distributed. The study also suggests that the water on Mars was much warmer and wetter than it is today, which increases the likelihood that life may have existed on the planet in the past. The findings support the idea that Mars was once a warm and wet planet with long-lasting bodies of water, including lakes, deltas, and possibly even seas. The study's lead author, Geronimo Villanueva, said that the discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars could help explain why the planet's atmosphere is so thin today.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The university will repay an 83-year-old donation to remove the Confederate name from the residence hall. The building was opened in 1935 with the help of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, who donated $50,000 to construct and name the building. Vanderbilt first tried to rename the building in 2002, but the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. In 2005, Vanderbilt began referring to the building as Memorial Hall, but the word \"Confederate\" remained on the exterior. The university has now raised $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy, allowing them to remove the Confederate name from the building. Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos believes that the name change is necessary because the building's name is a symbol of racism, slavery, and the Civil War. The university has faced criticism from those who believe that changing the name of a building is a form of rewriting history. However, Zeppos argues that the name change is necessary to teach history in a more accurate way. The decision to rename the building comes at a time when universities across the country are grappling with the legacy of slavery and racism on their campuses.
