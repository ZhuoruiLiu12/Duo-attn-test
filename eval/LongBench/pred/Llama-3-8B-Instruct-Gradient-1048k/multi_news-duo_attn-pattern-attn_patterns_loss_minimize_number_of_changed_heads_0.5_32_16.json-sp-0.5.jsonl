McCullough was serving a life sentence for the 1957 murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph in Sycamore, Illinois. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough's lawyers and the DeKalb County state's attorney, Richard Schmack, argued that McCullough's conviction was based on false testimony, improper legal rulings controlling the evidence presented, and a timeline that was tweaked some 50 years after the fact to rule out McCullough's alibi. McCullough has long insisted that he couldn't possibly have abducted and killed the child because he was 40 miles away in Rockford, Illinois, talking to recruiters and trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force when she was taken. The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. She was with her friend, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957, when a young man approached them, introduced himself as \"Johnny,\" and offered them piggyback rides. Sigman went home to fetch her mittens, and when she returned, Maria and Johnny were gone. More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, and within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects, including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared. Despite the work of nearly three-dozen FBI agents, the investigation turned up no solid leads to Maria's whereabouts. Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. McCullough was convicted in 2012, and an Illinois appeals court upheld his conviction last year. However, McCullough made a last-ditch appeal in a jailhouse motion last December, saying police and prosecutors buried evidence supporting his alibi. The prosecutor, Richard Schmack, who inherited the case from predecessor Clay Campbell, sat through the trial and always doubted whether there was enough evidence to support the conviction.

It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened.

According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes severe infections to the skin, bloodstream, or surgical site, and is resistant to antibiotics. The study found that cigarette smoke fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs by making them more resistant to the immune system's defense mechanisms. The study also discovered that cigarette smoke makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotic treatments, making it more difficult to treat infections caused by the bacteria. The study suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also makes them more susceptible to infectious diseases.

Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team found that Sinatra was the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was applied to all 24 editions of Wikipedia, Adolf Hitler was found to be the most important person.

The analysis showed that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are male and were born in western countries after the 17th century. The study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so that most of its own historical figures are born in the countries which use the language of the edition. The study used Google's PageRank algorithm to determine the importance of individuals on Wikipedia.

The study's results were somewhat surprising, as the most important person in the world was found to be Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist.

Davis has previously faced criticism for downplaying her first husband's role in her life, but the memoir provides more insight into their relationship. Davis' memoir is dedicated to her two daughters, Amber and Dru, and her late father, who she describes as \"magic\" for instilling in her a sense of self-worth. Davis' book also includes stories of her time in the Texas Senate and her decision to run for governor. Davis' memoir is expected to be a bestseller, with pre-orders already exceeding 10,000 copies.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) is pushing for a compromise between his party's earlier efforts to repeal the health law entirely and Democrats' desire to make no changes to it.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The South African National Parks have vowed to put him down once they capture him, prompting a Twitter hashtag #SaveSylvester and an online petition to rescue the big cat. This is not the first time Sylvester has strayed away from the park. \n\nThe incidents highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflicts with livestock herders.

{"pred": "Archaeologists in Bulgaria have discovered a lead vessel containing ashes from the alleged grave of John the Apostle, one of Jesus' twelve apostles. The vessel was found in a reliquary that dates back to the sixth century C.E. And was once part of an early Christian basilica named after Saint John the Theologian. The reliquary was discovered during excavations of the ancient and medieval fortress and port of Burgas (or Poros) on Cape Foros in the Black Sea city of Burgas. The vessel is less than an inch long and is decorated with crosses. The discovery is considered one of the most important in the history of the Burgas Regional Museum of History. The vessel was found in the sixth century basilica, which was part of a complex of buildings dating back to the fifth and sixth centuries C.E. The lead vessel is unique because it contains images identical to those found on clay tubes produced in ancient Ephesus. The vessel is believed to have been brought to the basilica by a pilgrim from the fortress of Poros who had visited the grave of John the Apostle in Ephesus. The grave of John the Apostle was a popular pilgrimage site for Christians seeking healing. The discovery of the lead vessel is similar to another relic discovery made in the same region in 2010, when a reliquary containing the remains of Saint John the Baptist was found on the island of St. John in the Black Sea. The remains were later confirmed to be authentic by scholars at Oxford University. The discovery of the lead vessel and the reliquary containing the remains of Saint John the Baptist are significant because they provide insight into the religious practices of early Christians and the importance of pilgrimage sites during the Middle Ages. The discovery of the lead vessel and the reliquary containing the remains of Saint John the Baptist are also significant because they highlight the importance of the region of Thrace in the history of Christianity. The region of Thrace played a significant role in the spread of Christianity throughout the Byzantine Empire, and the discovery of these relics provides evidence of the region's importance in the early Christian Church.

The planet, which they have named Planet Nine, has not been directly observed, but its existence has been inferred from the motion of smaller objects in the region.

If so, he's expected to be out on Oct. 1. The televised hearing is being livestreamed at various sites, including CNN. Per CNN, one of the first questions posed to Simpson by a board member in regard to the robbery, in which he and other men entered a Vegas hotel room to reclaim sports memorabilia, was, \"What were you thinking?\" Simpson called it a \"big mistake\" and emphasized that he wasn't armed. \"I would never pull a gun on anybody.\" He insisted that he learned only afterward that one of the men with him, who was \"behind me,\" brandished a gun. Another board member noted that he hadn't taken an alcohol-abuse program as he promised he would at his last hearing. Other Simpson quotes: \"I'm at a point in my life where all I want to do is spend as much time with my children.\" \"I've basically spent a conflict-free life.\" Daughter Arnelle Simpson said her father is \"remorseful,\" and she wants him to come home so they can \"move forward,\" adding, \"It's been hard.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2613}

She also refused to take the soy-based formula that the doctor had prescribed, instead opting for organic soy formula from Whole Foods. Markham was arrested and the baby was taken into state custody. However, after several months, Markham regained custody of her son, with the condition that she provide a nutritionist's report within 10 days.

{"pred": "Colorectal cancer is often thought to affect primarily older men, but a recent study has shown that one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50. The study, conducted by the University of Michigan, raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. The study analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 of them, or almost 15 percent, were diagnosed before age 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer and more likely to receive aggressive treatments. Despite the tendency to have more advanced disease when diagnosed, younger patients tended to have better outcomes. The study suggests that the medical community should be aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50. The study also found that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50. The study's findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be changed to reflect the trend. However, the study's authors note that it is too soon to say whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. \n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of early detection and screening for colorectal cancer, regardless of age. The study's findings suggest that doctors should be on the lookout for signs of colorectal cancer in patients younger than 50, and that people with a family history of the disease or other risk factors should begin screening earlier than age 50. The study also underscores the need for more research to determine the best screening strategies for younger patients. \n\nIn addition to the University of Michigan study, other studies have also found that colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults. For example, a study published in the journal Gut found that the incidence of colorectal cancer in people under 50 has increased by 2.4 percent per year since 1998. The study also found that the incidence of advanced-stage colorectal cancer has increased by 3.3 percent per year since 2004. \n\nOverall, the trend towards increasing rates of colorectal cancer among younger adults highlights the need for increased awareness and education about the disease.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The discovery was made by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break while surveying the territory in Flinders Ranges with an aboriginal elder. The rock shelter with a blackened roof was found to be a human settlement, as it contained sophisticated tools and bone fragments from the largest ever marsupial. The site also contained evidence of human interaction with megafauna, such as the Diprotodon optatum, a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. The discovery suggests that humans may have reached northern parts of Australia far earlier than previously thought. The site, known as Warratyi, is significant as it provides evidence of the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia around 49,000-46,000 years ago. The discovery also pushes back the earliest-known dates on the development of key bone and stone axe technologies and the use of gypsum. The site has been dated using a combination of radiocarbon dating of the burnt eggshells, which are thought to be evidence of human cooking, and optical dating of quartz grains. The discovery has been published in Nature and has been hailed as a significant milestone in the debate over whether humans or climate change drove the extinction of megafauna. The discovery also challenges the assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The site is located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550km north of Adelaide, and is known as the Warratyi rock-shelter.

Overall, the article suggests that the idea of harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a way to increase resources, but also a way to prevent the universe from leaving civilizations behind.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed toolmaking advances and trading networks in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. The discovery was made by a team of international scientists who found evidence of toolmaking and trading networks in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya. The team found that the toolmaking advances were driven by dramatic shifts in the East African climate, which led to the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives. The team also found evidence of trading networks among dispersed groups of H. sapiens, or possibly among closely related populations, which they believe was a key factor in the success of early humans. The evidence suggests that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies to cope with them. The discovery challenges the traditional view that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that complex behaviors emerged much earlier, starting in groups that predated modern humans. The discovery also highlights the importance of social networks and trading in the success of early humans. Overall, the discovery sheds new light on the evolution of Homo sapiens and the development of modern human behaviors.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The new law paves the way for the establishment of a licensing agency to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes.

The legislation also corrects the victimization of Rastafarian brethren, who have been persecuted for their religious beliefs. The move is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and last year, Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. In 2014, Uruguay became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market.

The rocket attack on Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial center, has been ongoing for the second day, despite Israel's air offensive aimed at deterring Hamas from launching cross-border attacks. Hamas, the Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, claimed responsibility for firing at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The siren that sounded in Jerusalem stunned many Israelis, as the city was last struck by a Palestinian rocket in 1970. The Israeli military has reported that 75 rockets fired from Gaza have hit Israel since the conflict began, while 99 others were intercepted by its Iron Dome anti-missile system. The conflict has resulted in the deaths of 19 Palestinians and three Israelis. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has stated that he is committed to the peace treaty with Egypt, which serves the strategic interests of both countries. The US has urged friendly Arab countries with ties to Hamas to use their influence to defuse the situation. The conflict has led to a deterioration in relations between Israel and Egypt, which has seen ties fray since the election of an Islamist government.

A Hamas-run TV station reported that Israel had kept firing as well, but Israel says it took a break for at least two hours. In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have evolved. The ocean was a mile deep in some places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, which is more than is found in the Arctic Ocean. This discovery adds to the growing evidence that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with streams, rivers, and long-standing lakes. The study, published in the journal Science, used maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form to show that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen ice caps. The researchers believe that the water was lost due to a thinning of the planet's atmosphere, which caused more ocean water to evaporate into space. The study also suggests that the planet was wet for a much longer period than previously thought, which increases the chances of finding life on Mars. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life, possibly emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. \n\nOverall, the discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars provides further evidence that the planet was once habitable, and increases the chances of finding life on the Red Planet. The study also highlights the importance of studying the chemical composition of the Martian atmosphere to better understand the planet's history and potential for life. As technology continues to advance, scientists are hopeful that they will one day find evidence of life on Mars, and this discovery brings us one step closer to achieving that goal.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to those of modern birds, rather than the roaring noises often depicted in movies. The Tyrannosaurus Rex, in particular, may have made low, throaty sounds rather than the high-pitched screams often portrayed in popular culture. The discovery was made by analyzing the vocalizations of modern birds and crocodiles, and comparing them to those of extinct dinosaurs. The researchers found that dinosaurs likely made sounds with their necks, rather than their mouths, and that these sounds were often used for mating and territorial displays. The study also suggests that the ability to make these sounds evolved independently in different groups of animals, and that it may have been limited to those with larger body sizes. The findings could shed new light on how dinosaurs communicated with each other, and how they may have interacted with their environments. \n\nIn related news, a new collaboration between researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University in Arizona, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah is working to understand the origins and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds. The project, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, aims to shed light on how birds evolved to produce a wide range of sounds, and how these sounds may have been used by their ancestors. The researchers plan to use a combination of experimental techniques, including gene expression analysis and sound modeling, to better understand the evolution of bird vocalizations. \n\nFinally, a new study has found that the T. Rex's roar is not as fearsome as it once seemed. The roar, which has been used in movies like Jurassic Park, was actually created by mixing together sounds from a baby elephant, a tiger, and an alligator. The true sounds of the T. Rex may have been much more subtle, and may have been used for communication rather than intimidation. The study highlights the importance of using accurate sound effects in movies and other forms of media, and the need for more research into the sounds of extinct animals. \n\nOverall, these studies suggest that our understanding of dinosaurs and their behavior is constantly evolving, and that there is still much to learn about these fascinating creatures. As technology and research methods continue to improve, we may uncover even more surprising insights into the lives of these prehistoric animals. \n\nSources: \n- \"T. Rex's Roar Was Probably Not as Fearsome as You Think\" by Rachel Fobar, Smithsonian Magazine\n- \"New Study Suggests Dinosaurs May Have Made Sounds Like Modern Birds\" by", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The PS3 was a first step, which was designed to connect to a variety of services, but it was limited because of how early it launched in that world. The PS4 is an advanced, x86-based personal computer, which means that it should be easy for developers to build. The console will have a local hard drive, and there will be no native PS3 backward compatibility. However, PlayStation Cloud will allow for streaming access to old titles without the need for discs. The PS4 will have a redesigned DualShock 4 controller, which has a touchpad, a share button, and a light bar that will track movements with a PlayStation Move-style controller. The console will also have a social gaming interface, and it will study players' download and play habits to predict the next titles they will want to download. The PS4 will have instant game booting, and a secondary processor will handle downloading games in the background, allowing players to play games while they are being transferred from Sony's servers.

The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later. The couple also sent out invitations last week to a dinner party at their winter home in Palm Beach."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2360}
{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party expected to consolidate its lead. The elections come as prosecutors accuse former President Hosni Mubarak of being a \"tyrant\" responsible for violence and oppression. Mubarak is on trial for complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters during the 18-day uprising that led to his ouster in February. The trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted. The elections have been marked by violence, with clashes between security forces and protesters calling for an earlier end to military rule leaving at least 17 people dead. The lower house of Parliament is due to hold its first session on January 23, two days before the anniversary of the protests that ousted Mubarak. The elections have also been criticized for being slow to address economic issues, with foreign-currency reserves declining by 44% to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The country's military rulers have been accused of being slow to hand over power to a civilian government, with the elections seen as a step towards that goal. The Muslim Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government, but winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood's party to govern without forming a coalition. The ultraconservative Salafis have been the biggest surprise of the voting so far, winning up to 25% of the seats by most estimates. The Brotherhood has said it intends to form a coalition or unity government, but winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood's party to govern without forming a coalition.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
