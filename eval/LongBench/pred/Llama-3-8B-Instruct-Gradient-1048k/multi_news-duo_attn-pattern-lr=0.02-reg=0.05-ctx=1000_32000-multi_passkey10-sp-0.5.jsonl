Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is seeking to recover about $973,000 in costs from a high profile gender discrimination trial that captivated Silicon Valley, according to a court filing on Thursday. A jury cleared Kleiner Perkins in March of claims it short-circuited former partner Ellen Pao’s career because she is a woman. The trial helped spark a wide discussion about gender at the center of the U.S. technology industry. \n\nEllen Pao, now interim chief executive at social-news service Reddit, claimed her standing at Kleiner Perkins crumbled after she ended a brief affair with a partner.

Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. McCullough was serving a life sentence for the crime. The precise time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning. She was with her playmate, Kathy Sigman, on December 3, 1957, when a stranger approached them and offered them piggyback rides. Maria's friend dashed home to fetch her mittens, and when she returned, Maria and the man were gone. More than 600 volunteers combed the fields and woods around Sycamore in search of Maria, at times walking hand-in-hand in a grid pattern. And within 24 hours, dozens of FBI agents descended on the small farming community about 65 miles west of Chicago. Agents interviewed some 200 possible suspects, including McCullough, who passed a polygraph test about his alibi and was cleared.

Her body was discovered 144 days later by a couple looking for mushrooms near the Iowa border. She was under a fallen tree, some 100 miles from home.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial.

According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA, are vastly more difficult to kill when exposed to cigarette smoke. MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia. The study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was also more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. The study also found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA was more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The smoke-exposed MRSA also became better at invading human cells in lab cultures. The study was performed to examine an alternative to the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker. The alternative is that smoke actually makes the pathogen tougher. The study focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for that alternative.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

A Samsung statement said that data is encrypted to keep it safe, and that owners can disconnect the TV from wifi if they want to keep their data safe. Users can tell when the feature is activated because a microphone appears on screen.

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and the cause is unknown. Symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, an inability to pass urine, and, most severely, respiratory failure that can occur when muscles involved in breathing become weak. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but rather neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. The CDC has reported that, as of August 2016, there have been 50 cases of confirmed AFM across 24 states. AFM can be caused by a variety of germs, such as enteroviruses, which are common and typically cause milder illnesses in children, such as respiratory infections or even summer colds. However, when enteroviruses get into the central nervous system, they can cause more serious illnesses like inflammation of the brain. The best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, as the mosquito-borne West Nile virus is linked to AFM. The illness seems to peak in August to October, and there are no vaccines for this strain of enterovirus, so doctors urge good hygiene as the best defense. \n\nIn August 2014, physicians at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora, Colorado, noted a cluster of cases of acute limb weakness among children. Most patients were found to have distinctive abnormalities of the central spinal cord (i.e., gray matter) on magnetic resonance imaging, and most reported a respiratory or febrile illness preceding the onset of neurologic symptoms. On September 12, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment alerted CDC about this cluster. These cases coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease among children caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). On September 26, CDC issued a health advisory requesting state and local health departments to report cases and send specimens to CDC for testing. As of November 13, CDC had verified reports of 88 cases in 32 states. The median age of patients was 7.6 years (range = 5 months–20 years), and 54 (61%) were males.

{"pred": "Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has revealed in her upcoming memoir that she had two abortions. The first was a medical necessity due to an ectopic pregnancy, while the second was due to a fetus with a severe brain abnormality. Davis writes about the difficult decisions she had to make in both cases and how they affected her. The memoir, titled \"Forgetting to be Afraid,\" is set to be released on Tuesday. Davis' story has been a major undercurrent in the race for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. Davis' filibuster temporarily delayed the passing of sweeping new abortion restrictions, and she is now running for governor. The second pregnancy happened in 1996, and Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. However, a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind, and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. Davis writes that she had to make the difficult decision to end the pregnancy. The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" In the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes. Davis' filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide.

The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus “tremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized. After the abortion, \"an indescribable blackness followed,\" writes Davis in Forgetting to Be Afraid, \"and when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person.\" Davis also writes of a previously disclosed procedure to terminate an earlier ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo was implanted outside the uterus.

The rectangular building, believed to be one of the best preserved from the period ever found in the UK, has been made to look smarter with tonnes of white chalk brought from miles away and stamped into a kind of plaster. The house and other parts of the huge site have already produced finds including beautifully worked flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a beautiful little Roman brooch. Analysis of the mass of seeds and charred grains recovered will reveal what the people were growing and eating. The structure originally stood on a terrace overlooking a mound, within a small earth-banked circle, in turn part of the enormous Marden Henge. The site is so vast that it takes the team working on the house to the diggers who have uncovered a previously unrecorded Roman complex including the foundations of an impressive barn. The team from the University of Reading made the discovery while excavating Wilsford henge in the Vale of Pewsey. The body was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. Findings to date include flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. During the last six weeks, the team has focused on Marden henge and Wilsford henge. Built in 2,400 BC, Marden henge is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Dickson Wright was a champion of countryside pursuits and claimed she was prepared to go to prison to support people's right to hunt. In 2009, she was convicted of attending hare coursing. She was an outspoken campaigner for rural life and a keen supporter of the Countryside Alliance. She was also an advocate for eating the meat of badgers that had been culled. Dickson Wright was a former barrister who quit law and began working as a cook in grand homes. She was discovered by TV producer Patricia Llewellyn, who teamed her up with Jennifer Paterson for the Fat Ladies show. The show made its debut in 1996 on the BBC and was picked up in the United States the next year by the Food Network.

The app tracked her every move 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Arias claims that her boss, John Stubits, fired her shortly after she uninstalled the job-management Xora app that she and her colleagues were required to use. According to her suit, after researching the app and speaking with a trainer from Xora, Plaintiff and her co-workers asked whether Intermex would be monitoring their movements while off duty. Stubits admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments ever since she installed the app on her phone. Arias expressed that she had no problem with the app's GPS function during work hours, but she objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to Stubits that this was an invasion of her privacy. She likened the app to a prisoner's ankle bracelet and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. Stubits replied that she should tolerate the illegal intrusion because Intermex was paying her more than NetSpend.

The incident became public after one man got into a dispute over payment with a woman on the morning of April 12, drawing the attention of hotel staff and Colombian authorities, who reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. The Secret Service has also recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team before Obama arrived April 13. All of the recalled members were placed on administrative leave, and their top-secret security clearances were revoked.

Members of Congress who oversee the Department of Homeland Security — which includes the Secret Service — said they expected more resignations and firings in the case.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The probe will attempt to get closer to the sun's surface than any spacecraft has ever reached before, withstanding temperatures of almost 1,400 degrees and solar radiation intensities 475 times greater than on Earth. The mission aims to solve two long-standing puzzles: how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's outer atmosphere, known as the corona, is so much hotter than the solar surface. The probe will also help protect equipment from solar radiation and improve space weather forecasting. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the sun's heat, and will be outfitted with a 7.5-foot-wide heat shield made of advanced carbon-composite material. The probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying whatever inscription Parker wishes to provide. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The probe will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun, and will repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025.

Neiman Marcus apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner and said it did not believe the customers' Social Security numbers or birth dates had been compromised.

It details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.

The study also found that yo-yo dieting may have serious health implications for people with coronary heart disease.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

The study, conducted by Dr. Samantha Hendren and her team, analyzed data from patients diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2011. The results suggest that the medical community needs to be aware of the increasing number of colorectal cancers in young people. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively. The study raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. The researchers suggest that people with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50. However, it's too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect the trend. The report was published online in the journal Cancer. \n\nThe study also found that younger patients with tumors that had metastasized were more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments. Younger patients got surgery more often than older patients (72 percent versus 63 percent), and radiation therapy was used more often in younger patients than in older patients (53 percent versus 48 percent).

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

The article cites the work of astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev, who proposed three phases of galactic expansion, and Dan Hooper, who added a new twist to Kardashev's model. Hooper suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only the best way to increase a civilization's resources, but it's also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving a civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. Hooper proposes that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies, reel them in, and harvest their energy first, before those stars become inaccessible forever. The article also discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, and how they could be used to capture the energy of a star. The article also mentions the work of science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and his description of spherical, energy-trapping alien structures. The article concludes by discussing the potential for humans to detect these megastructures and the possibility of encountering advanced alien civilizations in the future.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed toolmaking advances and trading networks during the Middle Stone Age, around 320,000 years ago. The tools found in southern Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin were the oldest of their kind and were part of a long trend of climate-driven behavior changes in members of the Homo genus. The researchers propose that H. sapiens and their precursors responded to locations of food sources varying unpredictably on changing landscapes by foraging over larger areas with increasingly smaller tools. Obsidian used for the Middle Stone Age tools came from far away, raising the likelihood of long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations near humankind's root. The team's climate reconstruction is based on microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil. The new reports fit with genetic evidence that H. sapiens originated in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. The new studies also show that by 320,000 years ago this technology was well established in the region, suggesting that human ancestors likely started developing it even earlier. The diversity of stone tools from the Middle Stone Age suggests advanced thinking and planning. The researchers also find evidence of exchange of brightly colored red and black rocks that were then drilled into, possibly to extract pigment. This is the earliest evidence of the extraction of pigments, says paleoanthropologist Marta Mirazon Lahr. The new discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin suggest that hominin populations did not disappear – so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The \"human revolution\" that made us modern never was – archaeological evidence for modern behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species. \n\n[0_system],[0_user_0],0_assistant_0,[0_user_1],0_assistant_1,[0_user_2],0_assistant_2,[1_system],[1_user_0],1_assistant_0,[1_user_1],1_assistant_1,[1_user_2],1_assistant_2,[2_system],[2_user_0],2_assistant_0,[2_user_1],2_assistant_1,[2_user_2],2_assistant_2,[3_system],[3_user_0],3_assistant_0,[3_user_1],3_assistant_1,[3_user_2],3_assistant_2,[4_system],[", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

The Russian Embassy in Ottawa criticized the Canadian government for ignoring appeals from Canadian Jewish organizations and efforts by the Russian authorities to ensure that justice be served. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law enforcement body that reports only to President Vladimir Putin, charged Katriuk with genocide in connection with the 1943 killing of civilians in Khatyn, now part of Belarus. Katriuk was a member of a Ukrainian battalion of the SS between 1942 and 1944, and he denied the accusations against him. The Russian embassy in Ottawa called on the Canadian government to support a criminal case against Katriuk, but Canada ignored the request and said it would never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. Jewish groups have long urged the deportation of Katriuk, and they increased their demands for action in recent years after new scholarly research that appears to tie Katriuk to a 1943 massacre of villagers in Belarus. In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis but could find no evidence he committed atrocities. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship. Katriuk has said he was forced to join the SS battalion and did not participate in operations with the Germans. He said that while in Belarus, he guarded villagers, livestock, and resources from other partisan forces. Moscow's new demand threatened to reignite frictions between Canada's Jewish and Ukrainian communities over Katriuk.

He lost his bid for re-election to Bill Clinton in 1992, but historians have been kinder to his presidency than voters at the time.

He was a loyal lieutenant to President Reagan and left few traces of his own influence. Bush's shining moment as Vice President came in the aftermath of the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan, when the president lay near death in the hospital and the nation seemed leaderless. Bush inspired generations of Americans to public service, and in retirement, he undertook a few diplomatic missions and celebrated his birthday into his mid-80s with a parachute jump. Bush also had a close relationship with Bill Clinton, which began when the two worked together to raise money for victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and continued as they occasionally joined forces on other projects.

The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet’s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. The ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. The discovery adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago. The view of the planet’s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. The scientists used the Keck II telescope and Nasa’s Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. The high concentration of deuterium in water left behind goes up when normal water is lost on Mars, and the process can be used to infer how much water there used to be on the planet. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water has been lost. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet’s surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth’s surface. The ocean lasted for millions of years. But over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned. The drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exom", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
