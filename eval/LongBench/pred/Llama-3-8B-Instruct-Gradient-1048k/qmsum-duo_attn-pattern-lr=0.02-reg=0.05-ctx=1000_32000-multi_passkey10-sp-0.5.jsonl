Additionally, there was uncertainty due to the Augar review in England and Brexit. These challenges were not unique to Wales and were being faced by the majority of UK universities. The pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales also contributed to the challenges faced by Welsh higher education institutions, which were approximately Â£40 million worse off than they would be in the English system. The lack of capital funding available to universities also led to them investing in their estates, which was largely funded by borrowings. The costs of these borrowings had to be met on an annual basis, which was becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities had. The challenges were being managed, but more costs were being taken out, leading to more jobs being lost and more capacity being lost. The sector was taking out core capacity, which was impacting on the range of the curriculum, research, and innovation, and the range of the contribution that universities could make. The introduction of the Diamond reforms was crucial, and the Diamond money was coming in, with projections in future years being better still. The sector's performance was very good, with Wales being the best in the UK for national student survey scores and having the best impact from research in Wales across the UK. However, this was being done at some cost, with some universities having tired staff and experiencing stress. The sector was also facing some financial stress, with some universities having material uncertainty in their financial plans.
