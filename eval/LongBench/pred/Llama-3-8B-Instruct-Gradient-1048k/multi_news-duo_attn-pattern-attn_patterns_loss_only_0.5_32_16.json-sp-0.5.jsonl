The AK-47, which was designed by Kalashnikov, is one of the most widely used weapons in the world, and it has been used by many insurgent groups. Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Orthodox Church has a policy of supporting the creators of weapons that are used to protect the country.

The study used methods borrowed from Google to analyze Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. Taking all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia into account, Eom's team found that Adolf Hitler was the most important historical figure. However, when the study was conducted across all 24 editions, Michael Jackson took the second spot, and Madonna was in third place. The study aimed to determine if the online encyclopedia was skewed in the level of attention it gave to various figures, based on gender, time, or location. The analysis showed that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions were born in western countries after the 17th century and were male. The study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, so most of its own historical figures were born in the countries that use the language of the edition. The study used Google's PageRank algorithm to determine the importance of Wikipedia pages. The algorithm determines the importance of a page based on the number of important pages that link to it. The study found that the algorithm was thrown off by Wikipedia's almost complete collection of named species, which all link back to Linnaeus.

The settlement will give each of the 52 cheerleaders $2,500 per season they’ve worked, and squad members featured in photo shoots are eligible for an additional $400 payment per shoot. The deal covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 NFL seasons. The cheerleaders had claimed that they were paid only $150 per game and nothing for practice time. The Jets denied the claims and said they had reached a settlement to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation. The settlement comes after several other NFL teams have been sued by their cheerleaders over low pay. The Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills have all been sued. The Buccaneers settled for $825,000, while the Raiders settled for $1.25 million. The Buffalo Bills cheerleaders, known as the Jills, were recently given authorization to bring a class-action lawsuit against the team.

The disease is similar to polio and has been linked to viral infections such as enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). The CDC has reported 50 cases of AFM in 24 states since August 1, compared to just 22 cases in all of 2015. The majority of cases have occurred in children under the age of 10, and most have had a fever or respiratory illness before developing paralysis. There is currently no cure for AFM, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing further damage. The CDC is urging parents to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease, including frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick people, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. The CDC is also working with state and local health departments to investigate the cause of the outbreak and develop effective treatments. \n\nIn related news, the CDC has developed a faster test for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), which has been linked to the recent outbreak of AFM. The new test can detect EV-D68 in just a few hours, compared to the previous test which took several days. This will allow for faster diagnosis and treatment of patients. The CDC is also working to develop a vaccine for EV-D68, which could potentially prevent future outbreaks of AFM. \n\nOverall, the recent outbreak of AFM and the development of a faster test for EV-D68 highlight the importance of continued research and investment in public health.

Milano also pointed out that women have been made to feel that sexual harassment is normal, and that they have been silenced for too long. Milano's comments were supported by actor Minnie Driver, who called Damon \"tone deaf\" on Twitter.

The dinosaur had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, which were found to have a similar structure to those of hummingbirds. The feathers were discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation in Hebei Province, which is known for its well-preserved dinosaur fossils. The discovery suggests that the Jurassic period was a more colorful time than previously thought. The dinosaur was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, and it had crests above its eyes that resembled bony eyebrows. The feathers were found to have a similar structure to those of hummingbirds, with a similar shape and size. The feathers were also found to have a similar structure to those of modern birds, with a similar arrangement of barbs and barbules. The discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of birds and the development of feathers. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. \n\nIn related news, a new study has found that the feathers of the dinosaur Caihong juji were not just for show, but also served a practical purpose. The study found that the feathers on the dinosaur's head and neck were used for insulation, while the feathers on its tail were used for flight. The study also found that the feathers on the dinosaur's legs were used for display purposes.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

Arias is seeking damages in excess of $500,000 for invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and wrongful termination. \n\nIn related news, the StreetSmart app, provided by Xora, allows employees to create electronic timecards on their smartphones, which can be used to track their work hours. The app also allows managers to monitor employees' locations and movements. The app is available on over 140 different types of smartphones and tablets. The app costs roughly $1 per user per month. \n\nFinally, a recent study found that companies that prioritize customer service are more likely to retain customers. The study, conducted by the Aberdeen Group, found that companies that prioritize customer service have a 70% higher customer retention rate than those that do not. The study also found that companies that prioritize customer service have a 50% higher annual revenue growth rate than those that do not. The study suggests that investing in customer service can lead to increased revenue and customer loyalty. \n\nOverall, these news stories highlight the importance of protecting employee privacy and prioritizing customer service in business.

Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called.

The House has approved a plan to fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, which includes conditions related to the new federal health law. Senate Democrats have stated that they will not accept any changes to the health law, and President Obama has threatened to veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has been under pressure from conservative members of his party to continue fighting against the health law. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, close to the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a government shutdown. If the House approves a spending bill with no major changes to the health law, Republicans may not approve it until the last minute. The House and Senate could approve a short-term funding bill to buy more time to reach an agreement. If a shutdown occurs, it could have a significant impact on the Washington region, which relies heavily on federal funding. The shutdown could lead to a loss of $200 million per day and affect over 700,000 jobs. The region's economy is already weak, and the shutdown could exacerbate the situation. The shutdown could also have a ripple effect on state and local governments, as well as businesses and individuals who rely on federal funding. The Congressional Research Service has warned that a shutdown could have serious consequences, including the closure of national parks and monuments, the delay of passport applications, and the suspension of some federal benefits. The impact of a shutdown could be felt for weeks or even months after it ends.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The vessel is decorated with crosses and was likely believed to have healing properties by early Christians. The discovery was made during excavations of the ancient and medieval fortress site in Burgas, Bulgaria. The archaeologists also found a 10th century Bulgarian royal seal at the site. The vessel is one of only 43 lead tubes from the time period known worldwide, and only 20 of those have been found in the St. John the Baptist Basilica in Monza, Italy. The vessel is believed to have been brought to the site by a pilgrim from the fortress of Poros, where it was used to hold ashes from the grave of John the Apostle. The ashes were believed to have healing properties and were collected by pilgrims and taken back to their homes as proof of their pilgrimage. The discovery is considered one of the most important in the history of the Burgas Regional Museum of History.

The South Korean Navy conducted live-fire drills off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula in response to North Korea's nuclear test. The drills were aimed at checking the Navy's \"immediate operational readiness\" after the country's Air Force and Army conducted joint exercises.

The study, conducted by the University of Michigan, raises questions about the current guidelines to begin screening at age 50. The study analyzed data from patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the United States between 1998 and 2011 and found that 37,847 of the 258,000 patients were younger than 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer and were more likely to receive aggressive treatments. Despite this, younger patients had a slightly longer survival rate than older patients. The study suggests that the medical community should be more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients and consider screening younger individuals. However, it is unclear whether changing the screening guidelines to start earlier would ultimately lead to more cancer deaths being prevented. \n\nThe study also found that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon tumors will be diagnosed in individuals under 50.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The discovery was made by chance when a colleague needed a toilet break while surveying the territory in Flinders Ranges with an aboriginal elder. The rock shelter with a blackened roof was found to be a result of people lighting fires inside it, indicating human activity. The site contained sophisticated tools and bone fragments from the largest marsupial ever, which were found alongside evidence of human interaction with mega fauna. The discovery suggests that humans may have settled in southern Australia much earlier than previously thought, as the previous oldest human settlement in the arid zone was around 38,000 years ago. The site also contained evidence of human interaction with megafauna, which has implications for the debate over whether humans or climate change caused the extinction of these animals. The discovery has been hailed as a significant milestone in the study of Indigenous Australians and their history. \n\nThe excavation of the site was carried out using a 1-metre grid system, with each square metre subdivided into 25-cm squares. The team found 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from 16 different mammals and one reptile. The artefacts included sharpened stone and bone tools, red ochre, and gypsum pigments.

The team found that the quartz grains were between 44,000 and 49,000 years old, which is consistent with the radiocarbon dating. The team also used Bayesian age modelling to determine the age of the site, which took into account the age of the artefacts and the age of the megafauna remains.

To avoid this, civilizations would need to capture stars from other galaxies and bring them closer to their own.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

The EPA found that Magnolia had violated several provisions of the RRP Rule, including failing to obtain certification before conducting renovations, failing to assign a certified renovator to each project, failing to provide lead-safe work practices, and failing to provide lead hazard information to homeowners. Magnolia cooperated with the EPA throughout the investigation and took immediate steps to ensure compliance with the RRP Rule.

Lead poisoning can cause developmental delays, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems. It can also cause seizures, coma, and even death. The EPA is urging homeowners to take precautions when renovating older homes to prevent lead exposure. Homeowners can hire a certified lead-safe renovator to conduct renovations, or they can take steps to reduce lead exposure themselves. The agency is also urging homeowners to test their homes for lead-based paint hazards before renovating.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed toolmaking advances and trading networks in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. The Middle Stone Age tools found in southern Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin were previously thought to be no earlier than 280,000 years old. The tools were found alongside red pigment chunks, which were likely used for body decoration or to mark territories. The researchers suggest that the tools were made in response to climate shifts that caused frequent changes in food sources. The tools were smaller and more specialized than the earlier Acheulean tools, indicating greater control over the tools' shapes and sizes. The researchers also found evidence of long-distance trade, as obsidian was used to make the tools, and some of the tools were made at the site rather than being brought in as finished products. The discovery suggests that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop new technologies to cope with them. The findings challenge the idea that modern human behavior only emerged outside of Africa. The researchers suggest that the development of complex societies and technologies may have been a gradual process rather than a sudden revolution. The discovery also highlights the importance of studying the African continent, which has been overlooked in the past. The researchers hope that further discoveries will shed light on the evolution of human behavior and the development of modern societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Simpson was convicted in 2008 for his involvement in a robbery at a Las Vegas hotel, where he and five others attempted to steal sports memorabilia from two collectors. He was sentenced to nine to 33 years in prison. Simpson's net worth was estimated to be $10.8 million at the time of his divorce from his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson in 1992, but he has since lost most of his wealth. In 1997, he was found liable for the deaths of his ex-wife and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. Simpson was acquitted of the murders in 1995, but the trial was widely covered and remains a cultural touchstone. Simpson's upcoming parole hearing has generated significant media attention, with 30 media organizations expected to be present. Simpson has been in prison for nearly nine years and has been described as a model prisoner. If released, Simpson will be able to live on his NFL pension, which is estimated to be $25,000 per month. However, the Brown and Goldman families are expected to pursue any money Simpson earns in the future. Simpson's parole hearing comes at a time when the public's perception of him has shifted.

The legislation makes possession of up to 2oz of marijuana a petty offence that can result in a fine rather than a criminal record.

The new law will establish a licensing agency to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.

Egypt's prime minister, who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, has called for a ceasefire and has offered to mediate. The US has urged countries with ties to Hamas to pressure the group to stop its rocket attacks.

In Palestine the death toll has risen to 21, including 13 civilians, Reuters reports. Among those civilians were seven children and a pregnant teenager. Israel's death toll held steady at 3, despite the hundreds of rockets fired into Israel. But Hamas did up the ante by firing rockets near Tel Aviv for the first time. Air-raid sirens sounded (the last time they did so was during the Gulf War) and civilians ran for cover, though the missiles exploded harmlessly, with one going into the sea. \"There will be a price for that escalation,\" Ehud Barak vowed, according to the New York Times.

The ocean lasted for millions of years and was a mile deep in some areas. The ocean was discovered by analyzing the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere. The water vapor contained both ordinary hydrogen and deuterium, a heavier form of hydrogen. The higher concentration of deuterium in the water vapor indicates that the ocean was much larger than previously thought. The ocean was also much warmer than the current polar ice caps, which suggests that Mars may have been habitable in the past. The discovery supports the idea that life may have existed on Mars in the past. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover will be launched in 2018 to search for signs of life on Mars.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The researchers analyzed vocal data from over 200 bird species and found that only about a quarter of them make these sounds. The study suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations may have evolved independently in different bird lineages, and could have also evolved in dinosaurs. The researchers believe that understanding how birds vocalize can help us understand how dinosaurs made sound. \n\nIn related news, a collaboration between researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah is working to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds. The team is using a combination of fossil evidence, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to study the evolution of bird vocalizations. The researchers hope to shed light on how dinosaurs made sound, and what their vocalizations may have sounded like. \n\nFinally, a new study published in the journal Evolution found that the evolution of bird beaks is linked to the evolution of their vocalizations. The study found that birds with more complex vocalizations have more complex beaks. The researchers suggest that the evolution of beaks and vocalizations may be linked because both are important for attracting mates and defending territories. The study could have implications for understanding the evolution of other animal traits, such as the evolution of human language. \n\nOverall, these studies suggest that understanding how animals communicate can provide important insights into their evolution and behavior. By studying the vocalizations of birds and dinosaurs, researchers hope to gain a better understanding of these ancient creatures and their place in the natural world. \n\nSources: \n- \"T.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

However, the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name. In 2005, Vanderbilt began referring to the building as Memorial Hall, but the word \"Confederate\" remained on the exterior. To change the name, Vanderbilt raised $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The university's Chancellor, Nicholas S.

The decision to rename the building has been met with criticism from some, who believe that it is an attempt to rewrite history. However, Vanderbilt's decision to rename the building is part of a larger trend across the country, as universities and other institutions grapple with the legacy of the Confederacy and its impact on American society. Other institutions, such as Middle Tennessee State University, are also considering renaming buildings that bear the name of Confederate figures.

The PS3 was a first step, which was designed to connect to a variety of services, but it was limited due to its early launch in the world of services. The PS4 is an advanced, x86-based personal computer, which makes it easy for developers to build games. The console has a redesigned DualShock 4 controller, which has a touchpad, a share button, a headphone jack, and a light bar that tracks movement with a PlayStation Move-style controller. The PS4 also has a secondary processor that can download games in the background, allowing gamers to play while they wait for the game to download. The console also has a video-processing chip that allows gamers to stream video from their gaming sessions to their friends. The PS4 will have PlayStation Cloud, which will allow gamers to stream old games without the need for discs. The PS4 will be available in stores in the fall of 2013. The PS4 is an improvement over the PS3, but it is not a revolutionary leap forward in gaming technology.", "answers": ["Sony today unveiled its next-generation gaming system, PlayStation 4, saying the console will be part of a new ecosystem focused on hardware, software, and \"the fastest, most powerful gaming network.\" The new console is the Japanese electronics giant's first major game machine since the PlayStation 3 went on sale in 2006. Today's unveiling is Sony's attempt to steal the spotlight, at least until Microsoft unveils its next Xbox in June at the E3 video game expo in Los Angeles. Among the PS4's revisions is an updated controller that adds a touchpad, motion control, and a \"share\" button. The controller also features a light bar, which means a new PlayStation camera can more easily track the device.

The team used MRI scans to record the brain activity of participants as they watched YouTube videos, and then used this data to create a computer model that could predict what was happening in the video based on the brain activity. The model was then used to create a new video that was a surreal interpretation of the original. This breakthrough could pave the way for the ability to read people's thoughts and memories without visual stimulation. The technology could also be used to help people with paralysis control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. However, there are concerns about the potential use of this technology in detective work or court cases, as it could be used to access people's memories. The researchers are now working on improving the model to better understand how the brain processes visual information. \n\nOverall, this breakthrough in brain-computer interfaces has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and could lead to new treatments for people with paralysis or other disabilities. However, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of this technology, and further research is needed to fully understand its implications. \n\nIn other news, California scientists have developed a new way to detect and treat cancer using a combination of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Bayesian inference formalizes what may seem like common sense, allowing for the assessment of probabilities in various situations. The methods have been used in searches for sunken treasure, lost submarines, and crashed planes. In the case of the Air France flight 447, Bayesian statisticians helped locate the wreckage by focusing on the most likely location based on the available data. The methods are particularly useful in situations where there is limited data and where the search area is vast. However, Bayesian methods are not foolproof, and the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been complicated by the lack of data and the vast search area.

Sources have told the media that the couple were found hanging near an indoor pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion. Police say they haven't found any sign of forced entry, or a note that could explain what happened to 75-year-old pharmaceutical tycoon Barry Sherman and his 70-year-old wife, both renowned philanthropists. The couple's four children have rejected what they say are \"rumors\" that the deaths are being investigated as a murder-suicide, and many of the influential couple's friends agree. \"There is absolutely zero debate in my mind, this was a double homicide,\" says Canadian Sen. Linda Frum, a longtime friend of the couple, per the New York Times. The Globe and Mail reports that just days before the bodies were found, Honey Sherman was enthusiastically making plans for their annual trip to Florida, emailing friends that she would be traveling to the state on Dec. 18 and Barry Sherman would join her a week later.

{"pred": "Egypt is holding its final round of parliamentary elections, with Islamist groups expected to consolidate their gains. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party is leading ahead of the more conservative Nour party, which represents Salafis. The final stage of the vote covers nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The elections and the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak are taking place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who have said they will not hand over power until presidential elections are held by the end of June. The lower house of Parliament is due to convene on January 23, two days before the anniversary of the mass protests that led to Mubarak's ouster. The elections have been marred by violence, with clashes between security forces and protesters calling for an earlier end to military rule leaving at least 17 people dead. The slow pace of the trial has also been a source of frustration for many Egyptians, who are eager to see justice served. The prosecution has accused Mubarak of being a \"tyrant\" who used violence and oppression to maintain his grip on power. The trial is expected to continue for several days, with the prosecution presenting its case against Mubarak and his co-defendants. The outcome of the elections and the trial is likely to have a significant impact on the future of Egypt, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party potentially gaining a majority in Parliament. The Salafis, who are more conservative than the Brotherhood, could also make significant gains. The elections have been criticized for being flawed, with allegations of fraud and voter intimidation. The ruling military council has also been accused of trying to undermine the democratic process by limiting the powers of the new Parliament. The outcome of the elections and the trial is likely to be closely watched by the international community, with many hoping for a peaceful transition to democracy in Egypt. \n\nBased on the news, what are the potential implications of the Muslim Brotherhood's potential majority in Parliament? \n\nThe potential implications of the Muslim Brotherhood's potential majority in Parliament are significant. If the Brotherhood gains a majority, it could lead to the formation of a government dominated by Islamists, which could have implications for Egypt's relationship with the West and the rest of the world. The Brotherhood has a history of being more moderate than other Islamist groups, but there are concerns that a government dominated by Islamists could lead to restrictions on individual freedoms and human rights. Additionally, the Brotherhood's potential majority could lead to tensions between the new government and the military, which has", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
