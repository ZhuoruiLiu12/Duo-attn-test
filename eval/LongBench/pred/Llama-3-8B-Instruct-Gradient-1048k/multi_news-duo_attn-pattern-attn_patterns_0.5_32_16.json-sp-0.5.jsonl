In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

Wendy Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor of Texas, has revealed in her memoir that she terminated a pregnancy 17 years ago after discovering that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality. Davis, who gained national attention for her filibuster against stricter abortion laws, writes in her book \"Forgetting to Be Afraid\" that she and her then-husband made the decision to end the pregnancy after doctors told them that the fetus would suffer and likely be incompatible with life. Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, which she describes as medically necessary. The memoir, which goes on sale on Tuesday, is part of Davis' campaign to humanize her image and counter the narrative that she is an extreme pro-choice candidate. Davis' opponent, Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, has been a staunch opponent of abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. Davis' memoir also details her difficult childhood, including her parents' divorce and her mother's struggles with mental illness. Davis has previously faced criticism for downplaying her first husband's role in her life, but in the book, she credits him with being her partner and mentor. Davis' memoir is being released as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is heavily favored to win the governorship.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The tax has also been criticized for not applying to sugary drinks that contain milk, such as many flavored coffee beverages.

The incident began when the suspect opened fire on motorists on US Highway 78. The suspect then fled and was pursued by police officers. The suspect's vehicle crashed, and he exchanged gunfire with the officers. The suspect was killed, and the officers were not injured. The suspect's name has not been released, nor has the race of the suspect or the officers involved. \n\nOverall, these news passages highlight the dangers of gun violence and the importance of law enforcement in keeping communities safe.

The investigator also witnessed workers wringing birds' necks and leaving injured birds to die. Tyson has fired ten employees who were involved in the mistreatment of the chickens and has suspended the practice of inserting plastic rods into the chickens' beaks.

The House has approved a plan to fund federal agencies through Dec. 15, which includes conditions related to the new federal health law. However, Senate Democrats have rejected any changes to the health law, and President Obama has threatened to veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has been under pressure from conservative members of his party to continue fighting against the health law. The House and Senate could agree to a compromise before the Monday night deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies. If not, the House and Senate could pass a short-term funding bill to buy more time to reach an agreement. A government shutdown could have significant economic impacts, particularly on the Washington region, which relies heavily on federal funding. Local governments have set aside funds to mitigate the effects of a shutdown. The potential shutdown comes at a time when the US economy is already weak, and a prolonged shutdown could have long-lasting effects. \n\nOverall, the situation is fluid, and it remains to be seen how Congress will ultimately resolve the standoff. However, it is clear that the stakes are high, and the potential consequences of a government shutdown are significant. \n\nSources: \n- \"Congress races to avert government shutdown\" by Damian Paletta, The Washington Post\n- \"Government shutdown: What to expect if Congress fails to reach a deal\" by CNN\n- \"What a government shutdown would mean for the economy\" by CNN Business", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

{"pred": "Astronomer Mike Brown, who has discovered more than 30 dwarf planets and asteroids at the far reaches of our solar system, has been instrumental in the discovery of a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe they have compiled the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books. The planet, which they call Planet Nine, is estimated to be five to ten times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at a distance of 20 times further than Neptune. The planet's existence was inferred from the motion of smaller objects in the outer solar system, which appear to be influenced by its gravitational pull. Brown and Batygin's research suggests that Planet Nine is an icy, rocky world with a small envelope of gas, and that it may have been flung into a highly elliptical orbit by the gravitational pull of Jupiter or Saturn. The researchers suggest that the planet may not be at its closest point to the sun for another 10,000 years, making it difficult to detect with current technology. However, they believe that with the right equipment and a bit of luck, Planet Nine could be discovered within the next five years. Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer,\" has been the subject of controversy since his discovery of the dwarf planet Eris in 2005, which was initially referred to as the solar system's tenth planet. The controversy surrounding Pluto's status as a planet led to the International Astronomical Union redefining the term \"planet\" in 2006, which resulted in Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet. Brown has no regrets about his role in the controversy and believes that the debate has helped to educate the public about the solar system. He also believes that the discovery of Planet Nine will be a significant moment in the history of astronomy, and that it will help to shed light on the formation of the solar system. Brown and his team are currently working on a paper that will be published in the Astronomical Journal, which will provide more details about their research and findings. \n\nIn related news, astronomers at the California Institute of Technology have discovered evidence of a ninth planet in our solar system.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study suggests that the medical community should be more aware of the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients and consider screening younger individuals. However, it is unclear whether changing the screening guidelines to start earlier would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths. \n\nThe study also found that by 2030, nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon tumors will be diagnosed in people under 50. The study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, suggests that the medical community should be prepared for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support. \n\nOverall, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and screening for colorectal cancer in younger individuals.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The violations were discovered after the EPA reviewed several seasons of Fixer Upper, which aired on HGTV. The show was a popular program that aired for five seasons and was watched by over 3 million viewers. The EPA has stated that lead-based paint is still present in many homes and apartments across the country, and that exposure to lead dust can cause serious health problems, especially for young children. The agency has implemented the RRP Rule to ensure that renovations are conducted safely and without exposing occupants to lead-based paint hazards. The RRP Rule requires contractors to use lead-safe work practices, obtain certification, and provide lead hazard information to homeowners. The EPA has also implemented other rules to reduce lead exposure, including the Lead-Based Paint Disclosure Rule, which requires sellers and landlords to disclose the presence of lead-based paint in homes built before 1978. The agency has also implemented the Lead Safe Homes Rule, which requires contractors to be certified and use lead-safe work practices when renovating homes built before 1978.

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed toolmaking advances and trading networks in East Africa around 320,000 years ago. The discovery was made by analyzing Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment chunks from the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya. The tools were found to be the oldest of their kind, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. The researchers believe that the development of these tools was driven by dramatic shifts in the East African climate, which led to the need for Homo sapiens to adapt to changing landscapes and acquire new resources. The tools were also found to be more specialized and diverse than previously thought, suggesting that Homo sapiens were more advanced than previously believed. The discovery challenges the long-held belief that modern human behavior emerged in Europe around 40,000 years ago. Instead, it suggests that Homo sapiens were already exhibiting modern behaviors in Africa much earlier. The researchers also found evidence of long-distance trade networks, with obsidian tools being sourced from up to 50 kilometers away. This suggests that Homo sapiens were able to communicate and cooperate with other groups over long distances, which is a key characteristic of modern human behavior. Overall, the discovery provides new insights into the evolution of Homo sapiens and challenges our understanding of when and where modern human behavior emerged.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

{"pred": "Scientists have discovered that an ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for life to have emerged. The ocean was about 20 million cubic kilometers in size, which is more than the amount of water in the Arctic Ocean. The discovery was made by analyzing maps of atmospheric water and its deuterated form across the Martian globe. The maps showed strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss. The maps also revealed that the released water had a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean. Certain basins and orographic depressions showed even higher enrichment, while high-altitude regions showed much lower values. The atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which means that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. The study suggests that water loss on Mars was much more significant than previously thought, and the planet was much wetter in the past. The discovery supports the notion that life might have existed on Mars in the past, as the ancient chemical environment was more conducive to life.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Instead, they may have made sounds closer to those of modern birds, such as the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich. The study found that dinosaurs likely made \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low-pitched sounds that are produced by inflating a pouch in the throat. The researchers analyzed vocal data from over 200 bird species and found that only about a quarter of them make these types of sounds. The study suggests that closed-mouth vocalizations may have evolved independently in different groups of animals, including birds and crocodiles. The findings could shed light on how dinosaurs communicated and may help us better understand their behavior. \n\nIn related news, a collaboration between researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah is studying the evolution of bird vocalizations. The team is using a variety of methods, including fossil analysis, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling, to better understand how early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors communicated.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

However, the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued to keep the original name, and a court ruled that Vanderbilt could only remove \"Confederate\" from the inscription if it returned the donation at its current value. Vanderbilt has now raised $1.2 million to repay the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the university's board of trustees authorized the move this summer. The decision to rename the building comes as universities across the country grapple with the legacy of slavery and racism on their campuses. The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the US, has also urged its congregations to stop displaying Confederate flags. Meanwhile, the Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro is seeking to remove the name of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. The Tennessee Historical Commission will now have to approve the change, and the process could take several months. The move to rename the building has been met with criticism from some who argue that it is an attempt to rewrite history. However, Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas S.

Egeland was set to start serving a decade-long federal prison term from a high-profile mortgage fraud case. The judge called Egeland's insurance scheme and concocted shooting \"an unthinkable kind of situation\" and tacked on the additional time to his 10-year sentence for mortgage fraud. Egeland's insurance scheme and shooting led to the amputation of his left leg. He had his teenage son shoot him in the leg with a shotgun, which he had directed him to do, in order to delay his prison sentence and benefit from an insurance policy he had taken out. The judge urged Egeland to seek mental health treatment and counseling while in prison. Egeland had previously been convicted of mortgage fraud and had been involved in a mortgage fraud scheme that raised millions from local banks through a series of fraudulent loan applications. He had also been convicted of other crimes, including delivering drugs near a school and perjury. The judge called Egeland a \"menace to society\" and said that the psychological and emotional damage he had caused his son was \"unimaginable.\" \n\nEgeland's son, Rylan Egeland, was 17 at the time of the shooting. He was not charged in connection with the incident. The judge urged the son to seek counseling as well. The shooting occurred in Idaho, but Egeland was sentenced in Oregon. The judge also ordered Egeland to pay the $90,000 he owed in child support. \n\nOverall, the case highlights the lengths that some people will go to in order to avoid serving time in prison.
